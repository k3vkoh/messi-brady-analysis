  "<p>Hosting the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> was a tragedy for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=205\">Brazil</a> in 1950 and a farce in 2014. But there is one fortress that has yet to fall. They have never lost a <a href=\"/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.worldq.conmebol\">World Cup qualifier</a> at home -- though this has never seemed more likely than Tuesday night when world champions <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> pay a visit to Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã stadium.</p>\n<p>After five rounds of the 2026 qualifying campaign, Argentina are top of the table. Brazil are down in fifth, and if <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=209\">Ecuador</a> had not been punished for administrative irregularities, they would be sixth. After four bad games in a row -- and an unprecedented two consecutive defeats in qualification, some are suggesting that this is the worst Brazil side in memory. And this leads to the heart of the matter -- Argentina look like a team, Brazil look like a shambles.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<p>The <em>Selecao's</em> coach Fernando Diniz has run into predictable difficulties. He has built a career around being unorthodox. He trusts his players to construct relationships that will lead to flowing off-the-cuff passing movements. But this needs time to implement, and lack of time to train is the bane of the national team coach.</p>\n<p>With no previous experience at the level, Diniz is struggling badly. At least in last Thursday's <a href=\"/soccer/report/_/gameId/684601\">2-1 defeat to </a><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=208\">Colombia</a>, his side created chances -- they did very little of this in the previous three games. But the defensive side was a disaster. Even with his club sides, a Diniz defence can be exposed.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>His Brazil side have already conceded six goals in the current campaign -- more than they let in during the entire 2022 qualifiers, and more than everyone else this time round bar the bottom two, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/124121/bolivia\">Bolívia</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=211\">Peru</a>. And last Thursday was too much. Colombia had a barely credible 22 chances. Two-goal hero <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz\">Luis Díaz</a> alone had 10. A team that offers so many opportunities to the opposition is entering a lottery rather than playing football.</p>\n<p>Will Diniz opt for something more conservative against the Argentines? It is a possibility. Instead of what effectively was a 4-2-4 against Colombia, there must be a temptation to play an extra man in midfield on Tuesday -- where <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/320074/douglas-luiz\">Douglas Luiz</a> of <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=362\">Aston Villa</a>, for example, comes in for the injured <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/252107/vinicius-junior\">Vinícius Júnior</a>. But Diniz is just as likely to double down and go bold, with <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/217289/gabriel-jesus\">Gabriel Jesus</a> coming in to operate in a front four with <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/231050/raphinha\">Raphinha</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/267804/rodrygo\">Rodrygo</a>, and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a> clubmate <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/269844/gabriel-martinelli\">Gabriel Martinelli</a>.</p>\n<p>It was seven years ago in this fixture that Gabriel Jesus really announced himself as an international footballer, looking way too hot for the Argentina defence to handle in Belo Horizonte. And the same could happen again on Tuesday. The fascinating aspect of this match is that it is so easy to see where each side can do damage to the other.</p>\n<p>Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni has constructed a side basically made up of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> and his fan club. Those around Messi will do his running for him and allow him to save himself to make his dramatic interventions. The midfield of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/285450/enzo-fernandez\">Enzo Fernández</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/249299/alexis-mac-allister\">Alexis Mac Allister</a>, and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/174466/rodrigo-de-paul\">Rodrigo De Paul</a> weave their patterns in possession, circulating the ball and seeking to bring Messi into the game close to the opposing goal.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Argentina will look to make history and give Brazil their first ever home loss in World Cup qualifying on Tuesday night.\"></p>\n<p>And so if Brazil only play two in midfield (<a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/304216/andre\">André</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/218522/bruno-guimaraes\">Bruno Guimarães</a> were the pairing against Colombia), then Argentina will hope to lead them in a merry dance, playing around them and through them and exposing Brazil's weakness at full-back as the Colombians did to such good effect. It could be painful watching for the home crowd -- and the Maracana public can turn viciously against their own side.</p>\n<p>But for all the fact that they are a consolidated team, Argentina remain a team with an Achilles heel. Were it not for a magnificent save from goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/158626/emiliano-martinez\">Emiliano Martínez</a> in the last seconds of the World Cup final, then the entire narrative of Qatar 2022 -- and the biography of one of the all-time greats -- would read very differently. If <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/252971/randal-kolo-muani\">Randal Kolo Muani</a>'s shot had gone in, then the story would have been that Messi had been let down by Argentina's suspect defence. The back line creaked under pressure against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=628\">Australia</a> and the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=449\">Netherlands</a> and came close to collapsing in the final against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=478\">France</a>.</p>\n<p>True, for eight games after Qatar they did not let in a single goal. But this was always a little too good to be true -- and it had plenty to do with the lack of quality of the opposition. That run ended on Thursday. While Brazil were losing in Colombia, Argentina were going down <a href=\"/soccer/report/_/gameId/684598\">2-0 at home</a> to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=212\">Uruguay</a> -- and Diniz will surely be enthused by sitting down to watch the highlights.</p>\n<p>Uruguay were able to block Argentina and then pose a major threat on the counterattack. A couple of times, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/271788/darwin-nunez\">Darwin Núñez</a> was too quick for <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/119289/nicolas-otamendi\">Nicolás Otamendi</a>. He got behind the veteran defender and charged for goal -- and the second time, he ended his run with a cool finish which clinched the three points.</p>\n<p>Brazil lack a centre-forward with the power of Núñez. But they have plenty of pace, and slipping it behind Argentina's defensive line is where Diniz will count on winning the game and ending the year on a high. There is clearly more at stake for him than for his opponents.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens on Tuesday, Argentina will still be ahead of Brazil in the table. True, a second consecutive defeat will be a blow to morale, but Scaloni has always been aware that he would need to replace Otamendi before the next World Cup. He will have more than two years to find a solution. It is still not clear how long Messi will be around -- but Scaloni has already had an encouraging look at <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/277206/julian-alvarez\">Julián Álvarez</a> as a Messi substitute.</p>\n<p>Argentina, then, can afford to lose without it becoming a crisis. The same is not true of Brazil, for whom a first-ever home defeat in World Cup qualification would be seen as an extra dose of humiliation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Inter Miami's home schedule was completed more than three weeks ago, with Messi not playing that night - he had just gotten back from a pair of World Cup qualifiers with Argentina.</p>\n<p>Inter Miami was supposed to play a pair of games in China earlier this month, only to see that trip fall through because of what the team called \"unforeseen circumstances.\" When that fell through, Inter Miami settled on another option - getting NYCFC to play the exhibition. Messi has been training with the team for much of the last two weeks, arriving at the team facility the morning after getting the Ballon d'Or in Paris.</p>\n<p>\"I would like to thank all the people of Miami, not just the ones here in the stadium,\" Messi said. \"The treatment for myself and my family ... you've made me feel at home.\"</p>\n<p>Messi will likely play at least twice more in 2023 - Argentina has World Cup qualifying games against Uruguay (in Buenos Aires) on Nov. 16 and Brazil (in Rio de Janeiro) on Nov. 21.</p>\n<p>The team will likely begin training for 2024 in January, with the MLS regular season possibly starting in late February. It will be a hectic year for Inter Miami, which won Leagues Cup -- its first-ever trophy -- shortly after Messi signed with the club this summer. The club will play in that tournament along with the U.S. Open Cup and the CONCACAF Champions Cup in addition to the MLS slate in 2024.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>\"I have no doubt...that next year will be much better,\" Messi said. \"We will continue enjoying and try to win more titles, and I hope that you are with me.\"</p>\n<p>Martino was asked this week what still drives Messi. He said the level of competition that Messi has in practice would be the best answer.</p>\n<p>\"If you saw those, you wouldn't even have to ask the question,\" Martino said. \"You would just see right away what I mean.\"</p>\n<p>There are GOAT - the oft-used acronym for Greatest Of All Time - debates in plenty of sports. Basketball has Michael Jordan or LeBron James. Golf has Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus. Men's tennis has Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic. Some sports make it easy: Recency biases notwithstanding, it's hard to argue against Simone Biles in gymnastics, Michael Phelps in men's swimming or Katie Ledecky in women's swimming.</p>\n<p>Soccer might still have a debate. But eight Ballon d'Or trophies sure swing the argument Messi's way.</p>\n<p>Of the debate, Inter Miami forward <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/356358/Benjamin-Cremaschi\">Benjamin Cremaschi</a> said, \"I believe it's over.\" The 18-year-old Cremashi wasn't even 2 months old when Messi scored his first official goal for Barcelona in 2005. \"He's proved that for the last 18 years. I think he is the best player in the world, the best player in history. And I don't know if many people disagree. It's obviously a little bit biased, but from what I've seen, I haven't seen anyone better yet.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo caption=\"Kylian Mbappe can be classified as a triple threat thanks to his solid passing, dribbling and shooting, but there are other triple threats in Europe who have flown under the radar, even though they shouldn't.\"></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/253989/erling-haaland\">Erling Haaland</a> might be the <a href=\"/soccer/insider/insider/story/_/id/35853769/who-best-men-player-world-soccer-right-now\">best player in the world</a>, but he can't dribble or pass. I mean, he <i>can</i>, and he does both of those things better than just about every other human being who has ever tried to dribble or pass a soccer ball. But compared to his peers -- the other best attackers in the world -- he's awful at attempting either one.</p>\n\n\n<p>Despite playing on one of the most possession-dominant teams in the world, Haaland rates in the fourth percentile among <i>all</i> forwards across Europe's Big Five leagues in passes attempted per game over the past year. And he's in the 27th percentile for successful dribbles -- watch two <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> games, and you might see their starting striker beat a defender off the dribble just one time.</p>\n\n\n<p>The other day, I spoke to someone who helped build a team that won the Champions League and multiple domestic trophies. He told me that in recruiting attackers, they tried to <i>avoid</i> players like Haaland. Not Haaland in particular -- he's so good that you just sign him and figure everything else out after the fact -- but rather elite-yet-one-dimensional players who require sacrifices across the rest of the team to cover up their deficiencies.</p>\n\n\n<p>Instead, this club official and his team preferred what he called<em> \"</em>triple threats.\" \"If you can pass, shoot and dribble, you're a triple threat,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n<p>While these players might not be, say, 99th percentile goal scorers like Haaland, they might be in the 80th percentile for all three areas, and the benefit of these types of players is that they almost naturally fit together and complement each other immediately. If one attacker is a threat to dribble, shoot or pass in any moment, the defense has to respect it; this opens up space for the other attackers, and then the chain reaction continues on and on as they move the ball to each other. Plus, this distribution of talent allows for fluid, unpredictable movement among the front three, and it's also easier to cover up for injuries when everyone can play anywhere and occupy any role.</p>\n\n\n<p>Of course, only a handful of teams in the world can actually afford to acquire these players. \"Most teams have to make a compromise,\" he told me. \"It's a bit like that idea that you can have cheap, fast or good. Pick one of the three.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>But I do think there's wisdom here in attempting to identify players who don't have one particularly standout skill but function at an above-average level at everything. So, first, we're going to use some rudimentary stats to pinpoint the sport's top triple threats, and then we'll see if we can find some potential future stars, too.</p>\n\n\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<h2>The ultimate triple threat</h2>\n\n\n<p>A quick word here before we continue on, with all of the players currently playing in one of Europe's Big Five leagues. It might be limiting to call him a triple threat, but the reason <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> is the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/insider/soccer/insider/story/_/id/35259622/lionel-messi-world-cup-proves-best-male-athlete-ever\">greatest soccer player to ever do it</a> is because he was the best dribbler, passer and shooter in the world -- all at once, for more than a decade.</p>\n\n\n<p><video1></p>\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of the first part of this exercise, I looked at players who've hit the following criteria, per Stats Perform, since the beginning of last season in Europe's Big Five leagues:</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>At least 2,000 minutes players</li>\n<li>At least 3.0 shots attempted per 90 minutes</li>\n<li>At least 2.5 passes completed into the penalty area per 90 minutes</li>\n<li>At least 2.0 dribbles completed per 90 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n<p>There are only seven guys who hit each of those benchmarks. Six of them still play in Europe, and Messi is the seventh. The others are all somewhere between 20 and 27 years of age. Messi is 36.</p>\n\n\n<p>Last season with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, Messi averaged 4.1 shots per 90, 5.3 passes into the box and 3.2 dribbles. So, yes, sure, he mainly won his eighth Ballon d'Or because he won the World Cup with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a>, but it wasn't like he was just cashing paychecks in Paris. He was still doing what he has always done: everything, and better than almost anyone else.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The six other triple-threat stars</h2>\n\n\n<p>You're not going to believe it, but <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe\">Kylian Mbappé</a> also shows up on the list. And I might go so far as to call him a <i>quadruple</i> threat. Not only is he dominant once he gets the ball, he also drastically shifts the geometry of the opponent with everything he does off the ball, too. If you don't respect Mbappe's ability to break behind your defense, you're going to concede a lot of goals to him when he breaks onto passes behind your defense.</p>\n\n\n<p>This image shows how he compares to all other forwards across the Big Five leagues across a number of key metrics, and, well:</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1107/r1249871_533x800_2-3.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>He does it all. And at just 24, Mbappe is already not-defending at a veteran level, too.</p>\n\n\n<p>As for the other names, the ones who aren't quite as obvious? We'll start with a pair of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ITA.1\">Serie A</a> wingers who seem destined to become two of the most expensive transfers in the world at some point real soon: <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=103\">AC Milan</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/258917/rafael-leao\">Rafael Leão</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=114\">Napoli</a>'s Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.</p>\n\n\n<p>The former is 24 years old, and you can just watch this and see it all:</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>Kvaratskhelia, meanwhile, is still only 22. With Napoli's relative struggles this season, it might seem like the superstar <a href=\"/soccer/insider/insider/story/_/id/35905184/lessons-rise-napoli-star-khvicha-kvaratskhelia\">who came out of nowhere</a> last season has finally come back to earth. That's just not the case -- at all. He's scoring and assisting at roughly the same rate as last season, but his non-penalty expected goals+assists rate has taken a massive leap, from 0.51 per 90, up to 0.78. Kvaratskhelia's also carrying the ball into the penalty area more often than last season and beating more defenders off the dribble.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1107/r1249874_1039x1039_1-1.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>After these two, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a> each have their own established, in-their-prime triple threats: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/231050/raphinha\">Raphinha</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/202641/leroy-sane\">Leroy Sané</a>, respectively. And then after them sits the most interesting name on the list: <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=167\">Lyon</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/298008/rayan-cherki\">Rayan Cherki</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Bafflingly, Cherki hasn't played more than 52 minutes in a match since September. Perhaps related: Lyon have four points from 10 games and are currently bottom of the table in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FRA.1\">Ligue 1</a>. Cherki turned 20 only in August, but over the past calendar year, he's in the 88th percentile among attacking midfielders and wingers in shots per 90, the 99th percentile for passes into the penalty area, and the 97th percentile for successful dribbles.</p>\n<p>He's the most exciting under-21 player in the world who's not already at a super club. Per FBref's <a href=\"https://fbref.com/en/players/b34c63a5/Rayan-Cherki\" target=\"_blank\">similar-player algorithm</a>, Cherki's top three most-similar players are Sane, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/252107/vinicius-junior\">Vinícius Júnior</a> and Kvaratskhelia. This isn't a projection, either. These are the players he's most like <i>right now</i>. His prime is still nearly another half-decade away.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Cherki is just 20, but is putting up 'triple threat' numbers whenever he plays for Lyon. Is he the next big transfer target for top clubs?\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>The next triple threats</h2>\n\n\n<p>If we lower the threshold by 0.5 across all three metrics -- at least 2.5 shots, 2.0 passes into the box and 1.5 successful dribbles per 90 -- then the list expands to 22 players.</p>\n\n\n<p>Most of them are either well-known or not legitimate transfer targets. In the 30-plus range, there's Almeria's 31-year-old <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/193130/adrian-embarba\">Adri Embarba</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=432\">Galatasaray</a>'s 30-year-old <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/146324/wilfried-zaha\">Wilfried Zaha</a>. They're the oldest players on the list not named Lionel Messi.</p>\n\n\n<p>After that, there's a group of in-their-prime players either currently at bigger clubs or formerly <i>of</i> bigger clubs: Roma's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/164839/paulo-dybala\">Paulo Dybala</a> (29), Bayern Munich's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/184012/kingsley-coman\">Kingsley Coman</a> (27), <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=360\">Manchester United</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/230945/marcus-rashford\">Marcus Rashford</a> (26), Tottenham's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/194450/james-maddison\">James Maddison</a> (26) and PSG's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/229744/ousmane-dembele\">Ousmane Dembélé</a> (26). None of those players seems particularly likely to be leaving for a new club any time soon. Same goes for the likes of Real Madrid's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/267804/rodrygo\">Rodrygo</a> (22) and Bayern's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/303821/jamal-musiala\">Jamal Musiala</a> (20), two young stars still well short of their prime years.</p>\n\n\n<p>So, that leaves us with six. One of them just moved for €55 million this past summer: <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=362\">Aston Villa</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/270670/moussa-diaby\">Moussa Diaby</a> (24). In no small part because of his ability to contribute in three different ways, the Frenchman has hit the ground running, playing nearly 90% of the minutes for the team currently in fifth place in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Diaby has contributed in all key areas for Aston Villa since arriving from the Bundesliga this season.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Two of the others are already in their primes: <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=105\">Atalanta</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/229645/ademola-lookman\">Ademola Lookman</a> (26) and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=384\">Crystal Palace</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/251400/eberechi-eze\">Eberechi Eze</a> (25). The former was lights out in half a season with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=11420\">RB Leipzig</a> back in 2018, but never really put it together in any of the years since. He has been great for Atalanta in a more limited role, rather than as a play-every-game starter. It's easier to hit all of these statistical benchmarks when you don't play as much.</p>\n\n\n<p>Eze, however, has played more minutes than all but four of the other 21 qualifying players over the past two seasons. And he made it onto the list despite playing for a mid-table Premier League side, frequently as a midfielder. Given how rich everyone in the Premier League is now, signing him won't be cheap, but I'd be really interested to see how his multifaceted game fits in at a Champions League-level team.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=124\">Borussia Dortmund</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/259481/donyell-malen\">Donyell Malen</a> (24) is already playing on a Champions League-level team, and he's leading all wingers and attacking midfielders across the Big Five leagues in shots per 90 minutes over the past 365 days. <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=118\">Udinese</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/303296/lazar-samardzic\">Lazar Samardzic</a> (21) was almost playing on a Champions League-level team, too, but his move to Inter Milan over the summer fell through. Given his age and the quality of the team he's on, Samardzic is the much more intriguing target. But Malen ripped up the Eredivisie with PSV over multiple seasons before taking a bit of time to find his feet with Dortmund. He might be a bit of a post-hype sleeper, too.</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p>The issue with both players is twofold. First, both just barely meet the passing threshold. And second, Messi has played more domestic minutes in Europe than either of them since the start of last season. Your per-minute efficiency rarely improves with more playing time, and with any increase in overall time, their passing performance might suffer, negating any claim at triple threat status.</p>\n\n\n<p>And then there was one: <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=3997\">Sassuolo</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/272719/armand-lauriente\">Armand Lauriente</a> (24). He's a live-wire driving dribbler, but no particular aspect of his statistical production stands out as elite. The site Transfermarkt estimates that his transfer value would be only somewhere in the €18 million range. Lauriente, though, qualified for the list despite a relatively heavy minutes load (3,264) since the start of last season while playing on a midtier Serie A side. On top of that, <a href=\"https://analyticsfc.co.uk/blog/2023/07/19/renovating-the-cottage-why-fulhams-recruitment-matters-and-who-they-should-target/\" target=\"_blank\">a number of metrics</a> that attempt to estimate a player's overall impact also rate Lauriente much higher than you'd expect for an attacker who scored only six non-penalty goals last season.</p>\n\n\n<p>Perhaps Lauriente, then, is the model player for this exercise. Nothing about him, on its own, stands out as a skill that would help a good team win more soccer games than would the hundreds of other acquirable wingers out there. But when you add it all together, you might have a player who's more valuable than anyone could realize by simply perusing top-level stats or watching all of his matches.</p>\n\n\n<p>If I were a Premier League team, I'd give him a shot. For that kind of fee, wouldn't you?</p>\n\n",

  "<p><video></p>\n<p>While the Ballon d'Or itself has been presented in varying circumstances over the years, the core principle at its heart has remained unchanged. Ever since Sir Stanley Matthews became the inaugural winner in 1956, right up to <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\" target=\"_blank\">Lionel Messi</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38779218/ballon-dor-2023-lionel-messi-beats-erling-haaland-win-award-record-eighth\" target=\"_blank\">receiving the men's prize for a record-extending eighth time</a> Monday, being handed the golden ball is regarded as the most prestigious individual honour available in football.</p>\n<p>Originally, only players from Europe were eligible to win the Ballon d'Or (when it was commonly referred to as the European Footballer of the Year award) and the judging panel assembled by French magazine France Football, the founders of the award, consisted solely of journalists. However, this has been significantly expanded over time.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<p>In 1995, the award was opened up to players from anywhere in the world who plied their trade at European clubs, and then in 2007 it became a global award with coaches and captains of national teams also permitted to vote. This has since been limited to the coaches and captains of the top 100 teams in FIFA's world ranking.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the prize was merged with FIFA World Player of the Year award only for them to split again in 2015. That led to the rebranded The Best FIFA prize, which honoured both male and female players, and two years later the Ballon d'Or Féminin was created to follow suit (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38778014/spain-barcelona-star-aitana-bonmati-wins-ballon-d-feminin-award\" target=\"_blank\">and won this year</a> by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17640\">Spain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=20091\">Barcelona</a> midfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/268537/aitana-bonmati\">Aitana Bonmatí</a>.)</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Traditionally the award was bestowed to the player deemed to have performed best over the previous calendar year. This changed in 2022 when the parameters were shifted to acknowledge performances over the course of a footballing season instead.</p>\n<p>No player has won more Ballon d'Or awards than Messi, who has eight to his name. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/22774/cristiano-ronaldo\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is second on the leaderboard with five awards, while several footballing luminaries are tied in third place with three awards each: Michel Platini, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten.</p>\n<p>The award was not presented in 2020 due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which many feel denied <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/125824/robert-lewandowski\">Robert Lewandowski</a> what should have been his maiden Ballon d'Or.</p>\n<p>Here we present an in-depth ranking of every Ballon d'Or winning year/season of the modern era -- ergo, since the old European Cup became the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions\" target=\"_blank\">Champions League</a> in 1992.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38704303/messi-impact-inter-miami-mls-2023-beyond\" target=\"_blank\">Messi's impact on Inter Miami, MLS in 2023 and beyond</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>31. Matthias Sammer (1996)</h2>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Sammer proved to be a formidable presence at the heart of <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=124\">Borussia Dortmund</a>'s defence throughout the 1995-96 season as the German side retained their <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1\">Bundesliga</a> title, although they exited both the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/ger.dfb_pokal\" target=\"_blank\">DfB Pokal</a> and the Champions League at the quarterfinal stage. Sammer was similarly resolute for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=481\">Germany</a> as they won the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.euro\" target=\"_blank\">European Championship</a> (he even scored the winner against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=477\">Croatia</a> in the quarterfinals) which was just enough to give the sweeper the Ballon d'Or nod over <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> powerhouse Ronaldo Nazario by a single point in the vote (144-143,) the closest margin the history of the award.</p>\n<h2>30. George Weah (1995)</h2>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>The first edition of the Ballon d'Or to include players born outside of Europe was bestowed upon <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/team/_/id/4205/liberia\" target=\"_blank\">Liberia</a> striker George Weah, who finished the 1994-95 season as the top goal scorer in the Champions League with seven goals for PSG despite being eliminated by <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=103\">AC Milan</a> in the semis. He then joined Milan and won the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ITA.1\">Serie A</a> title in his debut season, though his Ballon d'Or came several months prior to the <em>Scudetto</em> being secured.</p>\n<h2>29. Pavel Nedved (2003)</h2>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>Industrious and influential in his attacking midfield role for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=111\">Juventus</a>, Nedved picked up a clutch of individual awards across 2003-04, including the Golden Foot (awarded to the best player in the world over the age of 29), FIFA's World Footballer of the Year and the 2003 Ballon d'Or. The flaxen-haired <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/team/_/id/450/czechia\" target=\"_blank\">Czechia</a> star was put forward as the winner by more than half of the 52 voters despite Thierry Henry hitting peak form for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a> during the same period, with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/478\" target=\"_blank\">France</a> forward scoring more than 40 goals for club and country over the course of the calendar year.</p>\n<h2>28. Roberto Baggio (1993)</h2>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Baggio scored a combined 38 league goals over the course of the 1992-93 and 1993-94 seasons. However, his only major honour of the period came on the continent as Juventus were crowned UEFA Cup (now known as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.europa\" target=\"_blank\">Europa League</a>) winners in 1992-93, with the graceful forward scoring twice and providing an assist in the two-legged final victory over Dortmund. The player known as <i>Il Divin Codino</i> (The Divine Ponytail) was still the reigning Ballon d'Or when he missed the decisive penalty in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/team/_/id/162/italy\" target=\"_blank\">Italy</a>'s shootout loss to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=205\">Brazil</a> in the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> final.</p>\n<h2>27. Michael Owen (2001)</h2>\n<p><inline5></p>\n<p>Owen followed Sir Stanley Matthews (1956), Sir Bobby Charlton (1966) and Kevin Keegan (1978 and 1979) to become the fourth English recipient of the Ballon d'Or. The exciting young striker burst onto the scene as a teenager with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=364\">Liverpool</a> four years previously and had already scored a copious amount of goals. His contribution to the Reds' cup treble in 2000-01 (comprising of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/eng.league_cup\" target=\"_blank\">League Cup</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/eng.fa\" target=\"_blank\">FA Cup</a> and UEFA Cup) landed him the golden bauble ahead of <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a> striker Raul and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a> goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.</p>\n<p>Owen scored two goals in a memorable win over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup final to complete the treble before also scoring the decisive goal in a 3-2 victory over Bayern Munich to land the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.super_cup\" target=\"_blank\">UEFA Super Cup</a> the following August -- the Reds' fourth cup triumph of 2001. Then, just four days after his 22nd birthday, Owen became the second youngest recipient of the Ballon d'Or behind Ronaldo Nazario, who still holds the record to this day.</p>\n<h2>26. Luis Figo (2000)</h2>\n<p><inline6></p>\n<p>While pivotal for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=482\">Portugal</a> at Euro 2000 and demonstrably brilliant in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/esp.1\" target=\"_blank\">LaLiga</a> throughout, Figo didn't manage to win anything during the calendar year in question -- the very year in which he found himself at the epicentre of the severe ructions caused by his controversial transfer between Barcelona and rivals Real Madrid. But that didn't prevent the skilful midfielder from taking the top honours in the Ballon d'Or vote.</p>\n<h2>25. Andriy Shevchenko (2004)</h2>\n<p><inline7></p>\n<p>Shevchenko was peerless for Milan in Serie A, scoring 24 league goals and winning the <em>Scudetto</em> during the 2003-04 season while staking his claim as one of the most fearsome all-action forwards in world football. However, the <i>Rossoneri</i> failed to make much headway in the Champions League knockout phase -- having won the competition the previous year -- and Shevchenko's aura alone wasn't enough to book <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=457\">Ukraine</a> a place at Euro 2004.</p>\n<h2>24. Kaka (2007)</h2>\n<p><inline8></p>\n<p>The last player to win the Ballon d'Or before Messi and Ronaldo's long duopoly over the award began, Kaka was excellent for AC Milan in 2006-07, particularly in the Champions League where the Brazilian's surging dribbles and creative attacking play were a prime feature of the <i>Rossoneri's</i> run to continental glory. However, his form was much spottier in domestic competition as Milan finished a distant fourth in the <em>Scudetto</em> chase and exited the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ITA.COPPA_ITALIA\">Coppa Italia</a> at the semifinal stage.</p>\n<h2>23. Marco van Basten (1992)</h2>\n<p><inline9></p>\n<p>The first player to be awarded the Ballon d'Or following the rebranding of the Champions League, Van Basten was lauded for firing AC Milan to the Serie A title in 1991-92 with 25 goals in 31 games before taking a starring role for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=449\">Netherlands</a> in their run to the semifinals of Euro 1992 that saw him wind up in the team of the tournament. Unfortunately, a persistent ankle injury effectively forced the Dutch forward into early retirement the following year.</p>\n<h2>22. Fabio Cannavaro (2006)</h2>\n<p><inline10></p>\n<p>A rare example of a defender having their efforts recognised, Cannavaro won the Ballon d'Or in 2006 almost entirely due to his stoic leadership of <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=162\">Italy</a> as they beat the odds to lift the World Cup that summer. Things then went awry at club level when Juve won the 2005-06 Serie A title only to have it taken away as an outcome of the <em>Calciopoli</em> scandal.</p>\n<h2>21. Ronaldinho (2005)</h2>\n<p><inline11></p>\n<p>The flamboyant Brazilian drove Barcelona forth to end their six-year wait for a LaLiga title. Ronaldinho \"only\" scored 13 goals in all competitions but his inventive link play and instinctive creativity allowed strike partner Samuel Eto'o to weigh in with a hefty 29 goals as Barca held off Real Madrid to take the title by four points. However, underwhelming collective performances in both the domestic cup and the Champions League took a little of the shine off things.</p>\n<h2>20. Rivaldo (1999)</h2>\n<p><inline12></p>\n<p>Rivaldo truly was Barcelona's leading light during the 1998-99 campaign with the Brazilian maestro scoring 24 league goals and laying on a slew of assists as the Catalans stampeded to the Spanish title, finishing 11 points clear of second-place Real Madrid. However, Rivaldo still finished runner-up behind Raul in the LaLiga golden boot race and only mustered five further goals across all competitions as Barca came unstuck in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ESP.COPA_DEL_REY\">Copa del Rey</a> quarterfinals after suffering the ignominy of failing to make it through their Champions League group.</p>\n<h2>19. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/76762/luka-modric\">Luka Modric</a> (2018)</h2>\n<p><inline13></p>\n<p>Dragging Croatia through to a World Cup final was no mean feat, nor was playing a central role in Real Madrid's valiant Champions League triumph -- their third consecutive European Cup win and 13th overall. It felt as though the footballing world had pointedly broken the Messi-Ronaldo stranglehold to salute the veteran midfielder for his brilliant career, rather than just his showing that year.</p>\n<h2>18. Ronaldo Nazario (2002)</h2>\n<p><inline14></p>\n<p>Grounded by a succession of ligament injuries, Ronaldo mustered just 17 league appearances across the three seasons leading up to the 2002 World Cup, though he did manage to score seven goals in 10 games for Real Madrid in 2001-02 in between layoffs. However, despite missing the entire qualification campaign, the World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea ignited something in Ronaldo who defied the naysayers and roared back to form, scoring a record eight goals at the tournament as Brazil became world champions for a record-extending fifth time. He was awarded the Ballon d'Or almost solely based on his performances in those seven games but, four years after he played in the 1998 World Cup final loss to France <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37496379/the-story-france-1998-world-cup-triumph\" target=\"_blank\">despite suffering a seizure shortly before the game</a>, it was hard to deny him his honour this time.</p>\n<h2>17. Hristo Stoichkov (1994)</h2>\n<p><inline15></p>\n<p>Another player who benefitted from shining on the global stage, Stoichkov was at his impudent best with Barcelona in the 1993-94 season as his goals helped deliver the LaLiga title. He then continued his form into the 1994 World Cup as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/team/_/id/462/bulgaria\" target=\"_blank\">Bulgaria</a> were the surprise package. While their underdog run came to an end against Italy in the semifinals, Stoichkov ended the tournament as joint-top goal scorer with six goals.</p>\n<h2>16. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/46858/karim-benzema\">Karim Benzema</a> (2022)</h2>\n<p><inline16></p>\n<p>Only the second player outside of the Messi-Ronaldo bubble to win the Ballon d'Or since 2008, Benzema picked up his first award in 2022 on the back of a hugely successful season with Real Madrid. Aged 34 at the time, the French striker picked up the mantle as <i>Los Blancos'</i> creative focal point and scored 44 goals in 46 appearances while winning both the LaLiga title and the Champions League, where he scored decisive goals at every stage through the knockout phase en route to the final.</p>\n<h2>15. Lionel Messi (2021)</h2>\n<p><inline17></p>\n<p>It's fair to say that 2021 wasn't exactly a vintage year for Messi, who reluctantly departed Barcelona after two decades in Catalonia and was only able to sign off by winning the Copa del Rey in his farewell season. While there were several standout performances in the Champions League, Messi made an uncharacteristically slow start to life at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, taking several months to bed in at his new club. The intervening summer international schedule offered a timely distraction from the heartache as Messi forged a career highlight by helping <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> steamroll their way to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/CONMEBOL.AMERICA\">Copa America</a>. Indeed, their captain finished as top scorer and was voted Player of the Tournament as the <i>Albiceleste</i> beat historic rivals Brazil in the final to claim their first major honour in 28 years.</p>\n<p>However, Messi didn't garner the popular consensus in 2021 with many believing that the Ballon d'Or instead belonged to Lewandowski, who had been so cruelly denied the 2020 award after France Football decided to cancel the whole thing at relatively short notice due to the \"lack of a sufficiently level playing field\" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>After hitting 55 goals in all competitions in 2019-20 and ultimately wrapping up a sextuple with Bayern, Lewandowski rolled over his lethal form into the following year and even went onto break Gerd Muller's 50-year-old record for goals scored in a single Bundesliga season on the way to winning yet another Bundesliga title. However, the Bayern poacher had to make do with finishing second behind Messi in the 2021 Ballon d'Or running.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a contrite Messi even made a point of imploring France Football to retroactively award the 2020 trophy to Lewandowski during his acceptance speech and that his rival deserved to have his accomplishments recognised.</p>\n<p>\"Robert, you deserve your Ballon d'Or,\" Messi said from the rostrum. \"Last year, everyone was in agreement to say that you were the big winner of this award. Hopefully France Football will give you the 2020 Ballon d'Or. We all believe you deserved it and I hope you can have it at home.\"</p>\n<p>Instead, the French publication hastily devised a new award, the \"Striker of the Year,\" which was doled out to Lewandowski as a vague consolation. Still, he managed to accept the meagre offering with sufficient gratitude.</p>\n<h2>14. Lionel Messi (2019)</h2>\n<p><inline18></p>\n<p>Messi won the Ballon d'Or for a record sixth time in 2019 (and his first since 2015) after he was directly involved in 63 goals for club and country over the course of the year. This included a portion of the 36 goals he scored in 34 league games as Barcelona successfully defended their LaLiga title in 2018-19, with a further 12 goals scored in just 10 Champions League appearances on top of that. As well as his 10th Spanish league title, Messi also won his sixth European Golden Shoe as the continent's top goal scorer and saw his exquisite free kick against Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semifinal (also his 600th goal for Barca) voted as the best goal of the tournament.</p>\n<h2>13. Cristiano Ronaldo (2013)</h2>\n<p><inline19></p>\n<p>After sitting idly by and watching Messi hoover up the four previous Ballon d'Ors, Ronaldo decided enough was enough and set out on a one-man mission to reclaim the precious trophy he had last taken as a Manchester United player. Ronaldo's attacking productivity was staggering, scoring 55 goals in 55 games throughout 2013, but unfortunately it didn't translate into any tangible honours as Real Madrid failed to win a single trophy over the duration.</p>\n<h2>12. Zinedine Zidane (1998)</h2>\n<p><inline20></p>\n<p>A staple on the shortlist for several years. Zidane finally had his moment in 1998. In perfect sync with Alessandro Del Piero and Fillipo Inzaghi, the French virtuoso had already played a major part in one of Juventus' most successful seasons, winning the Serie A title and only just missing out on the Champions League double after suffering the narrowest of defeats against Real Madrid in the final. However, his crowning glory came over the summer as a succession of dominant performances in the heart of the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=478\">France</a> team, plus two headed goals against Brazil in the final, saw Zidane ensure both his and <i>Les Bleus'</i> footballing immortality at the 1998 World Cup.</p>\n<h2>11. Ronaldo Nazario (1997)</h2>\n<p><inline21></p>\n<p>After missing out by a single point in the voting to Sammer the previous year, Ronaldo was made to defer what felt like an inevitable Ballon d'Or for just 12 months. Thankfully, the rampant Brazil striker was able to maintain his irresistible form, first with Barcelona and then with new club <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=110\">Inter Milan</a>. In just one season with Barca, Ronaldo powered through 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, winning the Cup Winners' Cup and Copa del Rey. He then switched to Inter for the 1997-98 season and promptly picked up where he left off, scoring 34 goals in his debut campaign as the <i>Nerazzuri</i> won the UEFA Cup. To date, <i>O Fenomeno</i> is still the youngest player ever to win the Ballon d'Or after winning his first at 21 years and 96 days old.</p>\n<h2>10. Cristiano Ronaldo (2008)</h2>\n<p><inline22></p>\n<p>After taking the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a> by storm with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=360\">Manchester United</a>, Ronaldo scooped his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 after finishing runner-up to Kaka the previous year. The Portugal international had begun his transition from wily winger to fearsome forward as he played an integral part in two consecutive title victories for Sir Alex Ferguson's United team and then opening the scoring against Chelsea in their rain-lashed 2007-08 Champions League final triumph in Moscow. All in all, Ronaldo scored 42 goals in all competitions during that campaign.</p>\n<h2>9. Lionel Messi (2010)</h2>\n<p><inline23></p>\n<p>Fresh from collecting his maiden Ballon d'Or in 2009, Messi continued in much the same vein the following year as his numbers continued to swell. Having switched from a wide role into the heart of the attack, the diminutive forward blossomed and scored 34 league goals in 2009-10 as Barca sailed to a second consecutive LaLiga title. The Argentine was equally accomplished in the Champions League, scoring four times in one match against Arsenal on his way to finishing as top goal scorer in the competition. However, Barca were knocked out in the semifinals by Jose Mourinho's dogged Inter Milan side and Messi also struggled to reach his zenith at the 2010 World Cup. He went home without scoring a single goal after the <i>Albiceleste</i> were heavily beaten by Germany in the quarterfinals.</p>\n<h2>8. Lionel Messi (2023)</h2>\n<p><inline24></p>\n<p>Messi extended his own prestigious record by winning the eighth Ballon d'Or of his career in 2023 which came after the veteran forward dutifully led Argentina to World Cup glory at the tail end of 2022. His club career had plateaued -- at least by his own inimitable standards -- during his second year with Paris Saint-Germain but the winter World Cup in Qatar provided him with both the platform and impetus to fulfil a lifelong ambition.</p>\n<p>After a frankly disastrous start to the tournament with a loss to Saudi Arabia, the Albiceleste's talismanic captain rallied his team and hauled them through to the final where they eventually ousted reigning champions France in an frenetic encounter -- allowing Messi to finally emulate his hero, the late, great Diego Maradona, by lifting the World Cup trophy at the age of 35.</p>\n<p>All in all, Messi scored seven goals and laid on three assists for Argentina at the World Cup and in doing so became the first male player to score in the group stage, the round of 16, the quarterfinals, the semifinals and the final of a single tournament. He was also named the best player at the 2022 World Cup, becoming the first player ever to win the Golden Ball twice after doing so when his country finished runners-up behind Germany in 2014.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that his domestic season was a total dud, either. Messi still won the Ligue 1 title and the French Super Cup with PSG, pitching in with a perfectly respectable 21 goals and 20 assists during his last campaign in Paris before departing for Inter Miami in July 2023.</p>\n<p>Messi has since made a predictably prolific start to his career in the U.S., scoring 11 goals in his first 14 games for Miami while also managing to win the Concacaf Leagues Cup -- his first item of American silverware -- in what was only his seventh competitive appearance for his new team.</p>\n<p>And with that Messi becomes the second oldest player ever to win the Ballon d'Or at the age of 36 years and 128 days. Amazingly, he will have to play on for a while longer if he wishes to hold that particular record too, as Sir Stanley Matthews was a stately 41 years old when he won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 1956.</p>\n<h2>7. Cristiano Ronaldo (2014)</h2>\n<p><inline25></p>\n<p>Ronaldo collected the 2014 award and unleashed a cathartic \"<em>¡SIUU!</em>\" in celebration on stage after winning his second Ballon d'Or in three years and third overall. He also managed to upstage his great rival Messi, who wore an incredibly snazzy plum-coloured, crushed velvet tuxedo to the gala event in Zurich only to finish a distant runner-up. Indeed, the Real Madrid superstar retained the prize after scoring 61 goals for club and country in 2014 with his newly set individual record of 17 goals in the 2013-14 Champions League easing the way for <i>Los Blancos</i> to finally complete \"<i>La Decima</i>\" by winning their 10th European Cup title, thus ending a 12-year wait.</p>\n<p>The final against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=1068\">Atletico Madrid</a> will perhaps always be remembered for the dramatic 93rd-minute header from <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/41579/sergio-ramos\">Sergio Ramos</a> that sent the tie into extra time, but Ronaldo's late penalty wrapped up the scintillating 4-1 comeback and saw the Portugal icon become the first man to score in the European Cup final for two different winning teams. However, Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or award didn't go without criticism, with many quick to point out that both he and Portugal suffered a dismal outing at the 2014 World Cup where they failed to make it out of the group stage after being hammered by eventual winners Germany in their opening game.</p>\n<h2>6. Lionel Messi (2011)</h2>\n<p><inline26></p>\n<p>Messi fended off a resolute challenge of Ronaldo to claim his third Ballon d'Or off the back of a season that saw him score 53 goals in all competitions as Barcelona won the LaLiga title, the Spanish Super Cup and the Champions League -- topping off their golden campaign with a stunningly dominant 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Wembley in which Messi managed to find the net. Messi was the top goal scorer in the Champions League, and his heroic showings against Real Madrid in the semifinals followed by a goal-scoring Man of the Match display against Manchester United in the final have gone down as era-defining individual performances.</p>\n<h2>5. Cristiano Ronaldo (2017)</h2>\n<p><inline27></p>\n<p>In utterly irresistible form once again, Ronaldo scored 42 goals for Real Madrid in all competitions in 2016-17 as the Spanish giants won the double; a dominant haul comprising their 33rd LaLiga title and their 12th European Cup -- and all this despite missing 12 games of the season due to a recurring ligament injury. The 32-year-old was especially immense in the Champions League where he scored decisive goals in every single round from the quarterfinals through to the final, where a Man of the Match performance saw Ronaldo score twice in a 4-1 trouncing of Juventus. What's more, his extra time hat trick against Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals also saw Ronaldo become the first player to score a century of goals in the Champions League.</p>\n<h2>4. Lionel Messi (2015)</h2>\n<p><inline28></p>\n<p>After back-to-back Ballon d'Or wins for Ronaldo, the trophy was returned into Messi's stewardship after the 2014-15 saw the Barcelona star hit new heights as part of the razor-sharp \"MSN\" attacking trident, alongside <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/272722/luis-suarez\">Luis Suárez</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/132948/neymar\">Neymar</a>. With Messi as the creative hub, the trio hounded defences across the continent as the Catalans won the Copa del Rey, LaLiga, the Champions League, the Spanish Super Cup, the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup in the space of 12 months.</p>\n<h2>3. Cristiano Ronaldo (2016)</h2>\n<p><inline29></p>\n<p>Ronaldo was at his unstoppable best throughout 2015-16 as the Real Madrid colossus blasted through hat trick after hat trick and claimed his third Ballon d'Or in four years as a result. Oddly, in terms of raw statistics, Messi actually had the edge on Ronaldo in 2016, with the former scoring 58 goals and registering 32 assists in 61 games compared to the 51 goals and 17 assists across 55 games accrued by the latter.</p>\n<p>However, while Messi and Barcelona won the LaLiga title and the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo enjoyed much more prestigious success by winning the Champions League (including a tie-turning hat trick against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=138\"> Wolfsburg</a> in the quarterfinals) with Real and then taking the weight of an entire nation's expectations on his shoulders to emerge victorious at the Euro 2016 with Portugal. Injury forced Ronaldo out of the Euro final after just 25 minutes but the 33-year-old still did his bit, performatively marshalling his teammates from the dugout as <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/123984/eder\">Éder</a> smashed home the only goal of the game in extra time against France.</p>\n<h2>2. Lionel Messi (2012)</h2>\n<p><inline30></p>\n<p>Decked out in a fabulous polka-dotted tuxedo for the occasion, Messi again emerged victorious in what had already ostensibly become a two-horse race to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Ballon d'Or. Messi was unable to deliver the LaLiga title (which went to Ronaldo's Real Madrid) while also being forced to watch on as Barça tumbled out of the Champions League in the semifinals after losing against eventual winners <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=363\">Chelsea</a> over two legs. Indeed, the Argentine was forced to make do with just another Copa del Rey to add to his trophy collection. However, he did score a record 91 goals for club and country during 2012 to smash Gerd Muller's previous high watermark of 85, so it is hard to argue with him claiming world game's top individual honour that year.</p>\n<h2>1. Lionel Messi (2009)</h2>\n<p><inline31></p>\n<p>In Pep Guardiola's first season in charge at the Camp Nou, Barcelona won no fewer than six trophies with an effervescent Messi propelling his team to a then-unprecedented Spanish domestic treble (La Liga, Copa del Rey, Super Cup) before adding the Champions League, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup to the collection before the year was out.</p>\n<p>After emerging as as bona fide superstar, the lank-haired 22-year-old Argentine forward saw his prodigious output rewarded with his first Ballon d'Or having finished a distant runner-up to Ronaldo in the previous year's vote.</p>\n<p>The great sea change was truly upon us. The new twin goliaths of modern football received successive Ballon d'Ors and kick-started a decade-long dominance of the award that only proved to fuel the intense rivalry and relentless, record-obliterating one-upmanship between the pair. It should also be noted that Messi romped to the 2009 Ballon d'Or by earning 473 voting points from a possible total of 480, beating Ronaldo by a vast 240-point chasm, the largest margin in the history of the award. It was as unanimous as it's possible to be.</p>\n<p>Messi was only the third Argentina-born player to win the Ballon d'Or after Alfredo Di Stefano and Omar Sívori did likewise back in 1959 and 1961 respectively. He was also the youngest recipient of the trophy since Owen successfully claimed the accolade as a 21-year-old in 2001.</p>\n<p>The fact that he is still habitually winning the award over a decade later is truly astonishing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Everything that I've achieved,\" Messi said after getting his award. \"The fortune I've had playing for the best team in the world, the best team in history. It's nice to win these individual trophies.</p>\n<p>\"To win the Copa America and then the World Cup, to get it done is amazing. All of them [Ballon d'Or awards] are special for different reasons.\"</p>\n<p>Prior to Messi receiving his award, Barcelona and Spain midfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38778014/spain-barcelona-star-aitana-bonmati-wins-ballon-d-feminin-award\" target=\"_blank\">Aitana Bonmatí won the Ballon d'Or Féminin</a> after a record-breaking year with club and country. She helped Barça win Liga F and the Champions League last season, before leading Spain to World Cup glory in the summer.</p>\n<p>In other awards handed out on Monday, Messi's Argentina teammate Emiliano Martinez won the Yashin Trophy for best goalkeeper and England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham was handed the Kopa Trophy as the world's top player under the age of 21.</p>\n<p>During his acceptance speech, Messi made a point of wishing Argentina countryman Diego Maradona happy birthday. The 1986 World Cup winner, who died on Nov. 22, 2020, would have been 63 on Monday.</p>\n<p>\"My last mention is for Diego [Maradona],\" Messi said. \"Today is his birthday. So I would like to remember him from here, surrounded by the best players, coaches and people who love football like he did.</p>\n<p>\"Wherever you are, Diego, happy birthday. This goes also to you.\"</p>\n<p>Even prior to Monday's ceremony in Paris, no player had won the Ballon d'Or more times than Messi, who first won it in 2009 and then again in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019 and 2021.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/22774/cristiano-ronaldo\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> has won it five times, while Michel Platini, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten are all three-time winners.</p>\n<p>Messi scored 21 goals in 41 appearances last season as <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a> retained the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FRA.1\">Ligue 1</a> title before moving to Inter Miami earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Since moving to the U.S., he has scored 11 goals in 14 games for Miami, helping the franchise win its first-ever piece of silverware, the Leagues Cup.</p>\n<p>However, he missed several matches through injury at the end of the regular MLS season as Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino's side came up short in their late push for a playoff spot.</p>\n<p>It is Messi's performances at the World Cup at the end of 2022 which have earned him an eighth Ballon d'Or, though, as Argentina ended a 36-year wait to be crowned world champions for the third time.</p>\n<p>Messi, as captain, was instrumental to Argentina's success in Qatar, scoring seven goals and assisting three more as he was named as the Player of the Tournament.</p>\n<p>He scored twice in the final and again in the penalty shootout against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=478\">France</a> as Lionel Scaloni's team edged one of the most memorable showpieces in the competition's history.</p>\n<p>Having come up short with Argentina at four previous World Cups, including losing the 2014 final to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=481\">Germany</a>, it was deemed by many to be his last chance to get his hands on football's biggest prize.</p>\n<p>At 36 years and four months old, he also becomes the second oldest player to ever win the Ballon d'Or, replacing last year's winner <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/46858/karim-benzema\">Karim Benzema</a>.

There's been hype, sure, when the league began in 1996 and when David Beckham arrived little more than a decade later. But this? <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> signing for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a>? This was unprecedented global fanfare.</p>\n\n<p>Life in America began with a bang for Messi. He made his debut in the joint MLS-<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/mex.1/\">Liga MX</a> Leagues Cup tournament against <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/218/cruz-azul\">Cruz Azul</a> on July 21, coming off the bench in the 54th minute to score a stoppage-time winner with an outrageous inch-perfect free kick.</p>\n\n<p>He'd go on to record 10 goals and an assist in seven appearances in the tournament, which Miami won -- the first piece of silverware in the club's four-year history. In MLS regular-season play, though, Messi would score just once and add a pair of assists in six games. Amid his mere-mortal production in domestic competition, the Herons' 2023 campaign ended prematurely, being eliminated from the race for a postseason place with two games remaining in the regular season. Now Messi & Co. are left to watch the MLS Cup playoffs from the comfort of their couches as they count down to 2024.</p>\n\n<p>\"I am proud of everything the team accomplished this season,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38723890/messi-looks-back-first-inter-miami-season-proud\">Messi said in a post on Instagram on Sunday</a>. \"With everyone's work and effort, we were able to win the Leagues Cup, achieving the first title in the history of Inter Miami CF, we reached the final of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup and we were even fighting to get into the MLS playoffs practically until the last moment.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are left with all the good things and above all with the desire to improve to be even more competitive next year.

Of the league's 29 teams, only the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=184\">Colorado Rapids</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=7318\">Toronto FC</a> had scored fewer goals to that point, and none had produced a worse expected goals (xG) at 0.97 per game.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that a Messi-less Miami could be competitive in the Leagues Cup would not have been worth considering. Then, of course, he arrived, and nothing was the same.</p>\n\n<p>From July 21, the day Messi debuted for Miami against Cruz Azul, until Sept. 9, his final game with Miami (against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=186\">Sporting Kansas City</a>) before suffering a hamstring injury with <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/202/argentina\">Argentina</a> during <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> qualifying, Miami went undefeated. In that span of 12 games that included seven in the Leagues Cup, four in the league and one in the U.S. Open Cup, Miami won eight and drew four. It outscored its opponents 33-14 and amassed 1.59 xG per game.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, Miami won the debut edition of the expanded 46-team Leagues Cup tournament.</p>\n\n<p>In a sport where an individual's impact can be tough to quantify, Miami's dramatic improvement speaks to Messi's value in a way even his own stats cannot. Still, Messi appeared in 11 matches in that 12-match span, scoring 11 goals with five assists. He scored in each of his first seven appearances, including two goals in each of the first three games he started.</p>\n\n<p>In all, Messi averaged a direct goal contribution (meaning a goal or an assist) every 68 minutes. For context, MLS Golden Boot winner <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/213304/denis-bouanga\">Denis Bouanga</a> of <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18966\">LAFC</a> found his way onto the scoresheet every 75 minutes and presumptive MLS MVP recipient <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/199958/luciano-acosta\">Luciano Acosta</a> of Supporters' Shield-winning <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> did so every 103 minutes.</p>\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Since his arrival over the summer, Lionel Messi changed Miami's trajectory on and off the field in a way that only he could.\"></p>\n\n<p>Miami's season almost needs to be broken up into three parts: Before Messi, With Messi, After Messi's Injury.</p>\n\n<p>In the With Messi portion, Miami was the best team in Concacaf. After it won the Leagues Cup, Miami had this aura of invincibility that suggested it would climb not only out of the basement, but that they would surge into the playoffs, at which point all bets were off. Before Messi Miami had dug itself such a hole, though, that the Herons had practically no margin for error if they were to qualify for the postseason.</p> \n\n<p>Then, Messi's injury only made it worse. Over the season's final two months, Messi appeared just three times, including a 90-minute outing on Decision Day when the team was already eliminated from postseason contention. And without him, Miami reverted to its early-season form, failing to win a single game in which he did not appear.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, only two teams in MLS finished with fewer points than Miami. <i>-- Kyle Bonagura</i></p>\n\n<h2>How Messi changed the face of Miami</h2>\n\n<p>For the Latino and Afro-Latino diaspora, Miami is a second home. It's American, but it's also something else for Latinos. It's Latin America's cousin, filled with Central and South American sounds and flavors. Spanish -- and mostly Spanglish -- is heard on every corner. From the Cubans in Little Havana to the Argentinians in North Beach, Miami's neighborhoods represent Latino culture.</p>\n\n<p>This is the most pivotal factor for Messi, his family and why they chose to come to MLS, but most importantly, Miami. After leaving Argentina as a 13-year-old, Messi wanted to feel closer to home, and he wanted to be happy again after a difficult period in Paris. Now in South Florida, he finally is.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is what I was looking for when we made the decision with my family: to enjoy it once more, as I've done my whole career, after two difficult years, the truth is we had it rough [at <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/160/paris-saint-germain\">Paris Saint-Germain</a>],\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOpCnZP3mcE&t=1s&ab_channel=ESPNFC\" target=\"_blank\">Messi told ESPN in August</a>. \"But as luck would have it, we're in a place where we're happy not just because of the results on the pitch but because of the everyday life with my wife, my kids, our lifestyle and the way we spend our time. Truth is, we're enjoying this moment very much.\"</p>\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n<p>The cynic will naturally bring up the economic incentives and how the Messi brand can grow in a country that is seeing the beautiful game spread faster than anywhere else on the planet. But the truth is that before being a World Cup champion and the greatest player the game has ever seen, Messi, like many Latinos in Miami, wanted to feel at home. Money is important, but it's not the driving force for Messi; if it were, there's little doubt he'd be playing in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ksa.1\">Saudi Pro League</a> right now.</p>\n\n<p>It's a complex, multilayered task to put into words the impact of Messi's arrival to the American soccer landscape because the footprint of his magic first begins with the impact he makes as a Latin American superstar. The magic on the pitch transcends the fact that it's coming, not from a European, but from a 5-foot-7 South American legend.</p>\n\n<p>You walk around anywhere in Miami and chances are you'll see an Inter Miami Messi shirt (fake or genuine). Murals adorn different neighborhoods, and in a city where the Miami Dolphins continue to shine in the NFL and the Miami Heat begin their new NBA season on Wednesday, it's Messi's face you'll see on billboards.</p>\n\n<p>Messi's arrival was more than just what you saw on the pitch. It was a cultural statement. It was the ultimate homecoming for the most popular Latin American on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Just as Bad Bunny, another megastar who equally creates a tremendous impact with his music, says in his song \"Vuelve Candy B\" from his new album, \"<em>Desde que Messi (Messi) está en la USA to' el mundo sabe quién es la cabra, ya no es Tom Brady, ey</em>,\" which translates as \"Ever since Messi arrived in the USA, now everybody knows who the GOAT is. It's not Tom Brady anymore.\"</p>\n\n<p>The point? In less than four months, Messi transformed the sporting landscape in America without speaking one word of English. You can't get more Miami than that. <i>-- Luis Miguel Echegaray</i></p>\n\n<h2>How opponents game-planned for the GOAT</h2>\n\n<p>You know how good Messi is when, after he scores and you lose to Miami, you can still feel good about your team's performance. That's exactly what Christian Lattanzio thought after his <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/21300/charlotte-fc\">Charlotte FC</a> lost 2-0 in the Leagues Cup quarterfinals.</p>\n\n<p>\"It seems quite strange to say that the plan to limit Messi worked quite well, yet we got beat and he scored a goal,\" the Charlotte manager said earlier this month.</p>\n\n<p><video2></p>\n\n<p>It's a feeling plenty of opponents in the league had after Messi's arrival. They had all the right ideas, they executed them well, and yet Messi still scored 10 goals in Leagues Cup play and added a goal and two assists in six MLS matches.</p>\n\n<p>Charlotte's plan was largely to make someone aside from Messi beat it, trying to keep Messi from getting touches in dangerous areas.</p>\n\n<p>\"You want to limit time and space on the ball,\" Lattanzio said. \"He's an exceptional talent, but there are other players who are very good [on Miami].\"</p>\n\n<p>Lattanzio took some solace when he saw an interview with Xabi Alonso, recalling that the former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a> ace said it took the legendary 2011-12 <em>Blancos</em> squad that reached 100 points in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/esp.1\">LaLiga</a> a year and a half to work out a strategy to stop Messi at his peak.</p>\n\n<p>\"That was one of the best Real Madrid sides of all time,\" Lattanzio said. \"That tells you the magnitude [of what] everyone is up against facing such a great player.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> manager Nico Estévez drew up what might have been one of the best game plans to slow Messi, putting Miami on the brink of a Leagues Cup exit in the round of 16. Although his team wasn't able to stop Messi either, it was the most difficult match for the Herons at least until the final, when they beat <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18986\">Nashville SC</a> in a penalty shootout.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think that much changes because of one player, even if it's Messi, though you do have to have a special alertness,\" Estévez said.</p>\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n<p>For FCD, that included a formation change, giving Messi's countryman <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/286516/alan-velasco\">Alan Velasco</a> a free role not unlike the way Messi plays. Velasco scored and played his best game since arriving in MLS last year.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're in a tournament where things were going well,\" Estévez recalled. \"Miami comes in, which was the hot team with Messi, Busquets, Jordi Alba, and at home in front of our fans, we wanted to show we have a high level and can compete at a high level and against them.\"</p>\n\n<p>Things were more difficult at the back, with defensive midfielder <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/200937/facundo-quignon\">Facundo Quignón</a> deployed as the defensive midfielder trying to slow Messi and getting help from <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/180955/sebastian-lletget\">Sebastian Lletget</a>. Messi, unsurprisingly, got his space early, with a sixth-minute opener, and late with a patented free kick in the 85th minute to send the game to a penalty shootout. Messi converted there, too, and Inter Miami moved on.</p>\n\n<p>The experience of game-planning against Messi in MLS, for now, is this: You can treat it differently, or you can treat it like any other game. In the end, it might be damage limitation. <i>-- Jon Arnold</i></p>\n\n<h2>What the league, and the USA, said about Messi</h2>\n\n<p>There was no shortage of fanfare when Messi joined MLS, and it makes sense: one of the greatest athletes of all-time was making the leap to the United States and planting his flag with Inter Miami. So how did things go? Let's let some of the most famous people in the world, teammates and opponents tell the story.</p>\n\n<p>NBA legend LeBron James was in the stands for Messi's first game in Inter pink, and he knows as well as anyone what transcendent excellence looks like, saying \"Always good to see and be in the presence of GREATNESS!!!\" on Instagram.</p> \n\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n<p>Messi delivered in that first game, too, coming off the bench to bury the match-winning free kick in Miami's Leagues Cup opener.</p>\n\n<p>NFL star Patrick Mahomes may play the other football, but he knew how special Messi and that moment was, tweeting, \"Wild man.\"\n\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n<p>\"Tonight's a dream come true for everybody in this stadium to see, and everybody in this country, to see Leo step into the MLS and perform,\" Miami part-owner David Beckham said after that first match. \"I don't have many words for that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Miami was one of the worst teams in MLS prior to Messi's entrance, but that changed as soon as the Argentine joined up. He was spectacular and, all of a sudden, so was Inter. \"Yeah, I mean, he is the best player in the world. So this is what he does,\" teammate Robert Taylor said after Messi led Miami to a 4-0 win over Atlanta that took them into the Leagues Cup knockout stages.</p>\n\n<p>Messi even managed to get Miami icon and rapper Rick Ross out to DRV PNK Stadium, too. \"This is my first football game ever. Lionel Messi has changed the entire energy of the state,\" Ross told Apple TV. \"This is different. Everyone in Miami, I suggest you come out and catch one of these games: it's a movement.\"</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Ross saw Messi lead Inter to yet another win as the whole team leveled up around the maestro. \"He's just so creative. I think he's allowing other players to flourish,\" Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender said. \"We're seeing a lot more creativity going forward. So as good as he is, he's making the players around him even better.\"</p>\n\n<p>With Messi at the controls, Inter surged through the Leagues Cup. Not only was Miami a competitive team with Messi, they were challenging for a trophy. \"I don't get tired of talking to him, I never will. It's amazing what he can do,\" Miami's teenage starlet Benjamin Cremaschi said. \"We can't wait so we keep on going like that and [he] helps us to get as far as we possibly can.\"</p>\n\n<p><video3></p>\n\n<p>Miami kept rolling through the Leagues Cup, beating one of MLS's best teams, Philadelphia Union, in the semifinals. \"The whole complexion of the team has changed incredibly,\" Union veteran Alejandro Bedoya said after Messi and Miami dispatched them. \"Just even talking to the young guys, Cremaschi is a great talent ... I was just talking with him and he even acknowledges how much everything's changed - the aura.\"</p>\n\n<p>Just days later, that aura delivered Miami the first trophy in club history as Messi and Inter lifted the Leagues Cup after a penalty kick win over Nashville SC.\n\n<p>Messi and Miami then turned their attention to the U.S. Open Cup, where they toppled MLS's top team, FC Cincinnati, in the semis. \"He makes the delivery on the plays that matter. And that's where he's a difference maker,\" Cincinnati manager Pat Noonan said.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Inter fell in the final, but they proved to be dangerous in league play as well. \"That team is the best by far that I faced in MLS, to be honest. By far,\" Giorgio Chiellini said after his LAFC side got thumped by Miami, 3-1.</p>\n\n<p>That match brought out a whole cadre of celebrities, who were champing at the bit to see the awesome Argentina international. \"I saw Michael Jordan one time and this is like the same thing,\" Owen Wilson told Apple TV before the match. \"There's really nothing quite like it. I've had people reaching out to me [for tickets] back in May,\" LAFC part-owner Will Ferrell said. <em>-- Ryan Rosenblatt</em></p>\n\n<h2>How Miami can add more silverware in 2024</h2>\n\n<p>Miami's midseason roster makeover was about as extensive as a team could get. It wasn't just Messi, Alba and Busquets arriving, but young South American talents like winger <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/298592/facundo-farias\">Facundo Farías</a>, center-back <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/358595/tomas-aviles\">Tomás Avilés</a> and central midfielder <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/192278/diego-gomez\">Diego Gómez</a> were brought in as well.</p>\n\n<p>Miami's spending spree -- doubling its salary expenditure vs. 2022 to become <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38683177/lionel-messi-tops-mls-salary-list-record-20-million\">the highest-spending club in MLS</a> -- wasn't enough for the team to grab a playoff spot, but the Herons will start next season with considerably more momentum than they did at the beginning of 2023.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time since Chris Henderson became sporting director in 2021, the team will be clear of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37617730/inter-miami-gets-mls-record-2m-fine-22m-cap-hit-designated-player-dealings\">the sanctions from violating the league's roster rules in 2020</a>, which included having its available pot of allocation money reduced by $2,271,500 spread out over the 2022 and 2023 seasons and therefore limiting their ability to bolster the squad from top to bottom. Now Miami will be on a level playing field in terms of roster rules, allowing it to leverage even further the spending power of owners Jorge and Jose Mas. The arrivals of young prospects Farías, Avilés and Gómez mean that a big chunk of Miami's recruiting for 2024 is already done.</p>\n\n<p>There likely will be a few additions, most notably the possible arrival of legendary <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=212\">Uruguay</a> forward <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/125088/luis-suarez\">Luis Suárez</a>. Suárez, 36, will be available given the reported termination of his contract with Brazilian side <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/6273/gremio\">Gremio</a> at the end of the Serie A season in December. Therefore, no transfer fee would be required.</p>\n\n<p><video4></p>\n\n<p>Given how the likes of Messi and Alba struggled with injury down the stretch, there are questions about the wisdom of making Miami older instead of younger. Yet manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino is clear that bringing in the former Barcelona striker is something he's considering.</p>\n\n<p>\"Within our analysis of the upcoming season, and the needs we may have, we have an analysis with Luis and an analysis without Luis,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38696043/martino-confirms-inter-miami-revive-luis-suarez-interest\">Martino told reporters earlier this week</a>. \"When the moment arrives to make Suárez's situation with respect to Inter Miami official, we'll be prepared to go in the corresponding direction.\"</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether Suárez arrives, forward <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/172688/josef-martinez\">Josef Martínez</a> will almost certainly depart. <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18418\">Atlanta United</a> picked up the bulk of Martínez's $4 million salary this season and while Miami has a club option for next year, Martino said about Martínez after Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Charlotte FC that it would be \"very difficult for him to continue in the institution [club] for next season.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/76762/luka-modric\">Luka Modric</a> has also been linked with a move to Miami, but barring a significant change in the league's roster rules to allow for freer spending -- multiple sources around MLS told ESPN that is unlikely to happen for 2024 -- there wouldn't appear to be room for both the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=477\">Croatia</a> international and Suárez.</p>\n\n<p>The aging legs of Messi and Busquets, 36 and 35, respectively, means that Inter require players to do the running in midfield for its stars. There are plenty of options already with recently re-signed midfielder <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/235893/gregore\">Gregore</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/198531/jean-mota\">Jean Mota</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/356358/benjamin-cremaschi\">Benjamin Cremaschi</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/144821/dixon-arroyo\">Dixon Arroyo</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/229289/david-ruiz\">David Ruiz</a>. That said, it would appear something would have to give there in terms of numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Miami could stand to have some additional help on the back line given that it conceded 54 goals this season, although the long-term injuries to Gregore and Mota didn't help in this regard. If Miami is going to continue to play a high line, it could stand to get some additional pace in the back.</p>\n\n<p>Even if most of 2024's recruitment is already done, the second half of Miami's 2023 season showcased how much potential is in the team. A full preseason and better minutes management of Messi, Busquets and Alba should ensure the Herons go a step or two further next year. <i>-- Jeff Carlisle</i></p>\n",

They didn't make the playoffs, but in a short span of time he already gave this young club -- and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> -- something to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38226342/lionel-messi-inter-miami-win-leagues-cup-mls-resumes\">after winning the Leagues Cup</a>, Inter Miami's first ever trophy.</p>\n<p>So what's next for Messi seeing as there is no postseason for him?</p>\n<p>Well, as we told you here on ESPN from the very beginning -- and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38684907/messi-rubbishes-rumours-loan-move-away-inter-miami\">as Messi himself confirmed</a> -- there was never going to be a loan deal to Europe or <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a>. He will continue to train with Inter Miami and prepare for CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers in November and then take a well-deserved break in December when he will head to Argentina before returning to work again in January. It will be the longest break this 36-year-old star has ever had in his career.</p>\n<p>This is something to celebrate and, whether he meant it or not, it's a great message for the rest of the footballing world. Players need more time off as the schedule -- including league action, international tournaments, qualifiers and friendlies, other domestic competitions, plus the summer calendar -- is too much. Look at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a> right now. Per premierinjuries.com, there are 131 total injuries from the 20 teams in the top flight. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/132948/neymar\">Neymar Jr.</a> just suffered another serious one against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=212\">Uruguay</a> this week, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38689169/neymar-torn-acl-set-surgery-injury-brazil\">an ACL tear and meniscus issue</a> that will keep him out for at least eight months.</p>\n<p>Messi's long break sets an example and choosing not to go on loan is a great message. Less is more.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<h3>AC Milan vs. Juventus: With American influence, a classic Italian rivalry is back</h3>\n<p>Through the years, AC Milan and Juventus have given us some of the most memorable games in Italian football. Indeed, not all of them were goal-fests -- the 2002-03 Champions League final comes to mind -- but overall, thanks to these two teams, we have witnessed some historic matches.</p>\n<p>There was the 1996-97 game where Marcelo Lippi's <em>Vecchia Signora</em> destroyed Milan 6-1 thanks to goals from Zinedine Zidane, Vladimir Jugovic, Nico Amoruso, Marco Simone and a brace from Christian Vieri. How about 2010 when Ronaldinho scored a brace and helped the <em>Rossoneri</em> earn a 3-0 victory? There are simply too many memories to remember.</p>\n<p>However, in the last few years the rivalry has lost its poetic gravitas but as we look ahead to Sunday, we could be in store for a fantastic encounter reminiscent of past battles. Milan currently lead the table on 21 points with Juventus trailing by four in third place so there's a lot at stake, even this early in the season.</p>\n<p>What's even more interesting is that we now have a distinctive American flavor to the game. With four goals and an assist in eight matches, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/225607/christian-pulisic\">Christian Pulisic</a> has finally found his home in Milan. He carried this confidence over the international break with a magnificent goal against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=481\">Germany</a> and another one against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=4469\">Ghana</a> in a 4-0 rout. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/307527/yunus-musah\">Yunus Musah</a> is also at Milan and has mentioned how this move has helped him grow as a player.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the other side, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/266027/timothy-weah\">Tim Weah</a> will see this game with a nostalgic eye due to the legacy of his father George Weah, who was one of the greatest African players in the history of the game and a legend with AC Milan between 1995-2000. He also happens to be a personal hero of mine.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>\"It will be a very special match, I can't wait,\" Weah told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"Obviously my father has an important past in the <em>Rossoneri</em>, so this match has a special meaning for my family.\"</p>\n<p>And let's not forget <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/256715/weston-mckennie\">Weston McKennie</a>, who has gone from being an outcast at Juve to an important part of Max Allegri's team. Much of that has to do with <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/138860/paul-pogba\">Paul Pogba</a>'s failed doping test and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38678886/juventus-nicolo-fagioli-handed-7-month-ban-betting-breaches\">Nico Fagioli's seven-month suspension</a> due to illegal betting. McKennie can now play a central role and reports suggest he might even get a new contract.</p>\n<p>There are key absences for Juve including <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/234306/federico-chiesa\">Federico Chiesa</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/306764/danilo\">Danilo</a>, and we'll have to see if <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/235677/dusan-vlahovic\">Dusan Vlahovic</a> starts after returning to training from a back injury. So, Milan at home are perhaps the favorites, but one thing is for sure: this historically impressive match-up seems to be back.</p>\n<h3>Paul Merson's powerful, important message for Sandro Tonali</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/38687785/sandro-tonali-available-newcastle-amid-betting-probe\">The recent news from Italy</a> regarding the betting investigation into Italian players has caused many headlines, specifically focusing on <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/261047/sandro-tonali\">Sandro Tonali</a> as it was confirmed on Tuesday that the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=361\">Newcastle United</a> midfielder is battling gambling addiction.</p>\n<p>\"Sandro Tonali is playing the most important match at the moment, the one against gambling addiction, and he will win this one too,\" said Giuseppe Riso, Tonali's agent, on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Merson, a former professional player, has never shied away from telling the story of his own gambling addiction as well as helping others, and took time to post some words of support for Tonali.</p>\n<p>\"Just want to wish Sandro Tonali all the best from this horrible addiction,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/PaulMerse/status/1714621194589085703?s=20\">Merson wrote on social media</a>. \"And hope FIFA and everyone else goes easy and to understand this is an illness and to stop throwing out big bans and to help people get help.</p>\n<p>\"I understand if someone is playing in a game and is betting on the other team, then a ban should (be) imposed. But people need HELP.\"</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>More often than not, the headlines are always focused on the person in question as opposed to the actual issue, and like Merson said, it's important to find a way to help them. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37933769/why-kane-leave-spurs-how-rice-elevates-arsenal\">I have already talked in the past</a> about the murky, contradictory relationship between betting and the Premier League, so this is really about the need for empathy and understanding that gambling addiction is a catastrophic problem for many people that doesn't only cause financial issues but also endangers mental health.</p>\n<p>Just like Merson <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/story-telling/15205/12499030/paul-merson-my-message-to-gambling-addicts\" target=\"_blank\">once said</a>, \"Addiction is a baffling, cunning, hideous disease that gets hold of you. Gambling addicts think they are bad people, but they're not, they're ill people who need to get well. That's the message I want to get across...hate the addiction, not the person.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>OFFSIDE</h2>\n<h3>Is Rooney the right choice for Birmingham City?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38613506/wayne-rooney-appointed-manager-tom-brady-owned-birmingham\">Wayne Rooney is ready for his managerial debut</a> with Tom Brady's Birmingham City (there's a sentence I never thought I'd write) and he'll return to coaching in the Championship when they travel to the Riverside for a game against Middlesbrough this Saturday. It will also be a reunion with his former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=360\">Manchester United</a> teammate and close friend Michael Carrick, Boro's manager.</p>\n<p>This is less about the game and more about this perplexing decision to hire Rooney, which in my opinion, was more about status as opposed to merit, especially in a situation where he replaced John Eustace, who has taken the club to a playoff spot in the table until he was let go to make way for the former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=448\">England</a> star.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Now, don't get me wrong, Wayne Rooney deserves nothing but respect for what he has given to the game. He is one of the greatest players England has ever produced -- but as a manager, there is still a long way to go. He valiantly coached a financially-ridden Derby County but in the end, failed to save them from relegation and just recently, in a league where more than half the teams in each conference make the playoffs, Rooney did not deliver in his attempt to secure a postseason playoff spot with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=193\">D.C. United</a>.</p>\n<p>There is an ongoing, institutional sentiment that former star players -- those who were incredible on the pitch -- are going to mirror their previous successes as a head coach, but that's not always the case. Of course, it does happen and many former star players have become incredible managers -- in fact, some of the best ever produced. Pep Guardiola, Zinedine Zidane and Johan Cruyff are just a few examples. And just like Xavi Alonso and Mikel Arteta, some of the current, best young managers were also fantastic on the pitch.</p>\n<p>But all those names went through a careful, detailed, step-by-step process when becoming a coach. They either stayed in a club to learn from the ground up or became students under great mentors. Rooney has not really experienced this as he jumped quite quickly without being an assistant or learning the ropes from deep within -- a contrast to Carrick who joined Jose Mourinho's coaching staff at Man United almost immediately after retirement.</p>\n<p>In the hiring of Rooney, I think City's new American ownership opted for optics and status as opposed to tactical substance. I might eat my words in the months to come and Rooney could indeed prove us all wrong but for now, I stand firm. Hiring Rooney is a big gamble for Birmingham City. </p>\n<h3>Al Hilal's poster on Neymar's injury</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/132948/neymar\">Neymar</a>'s ACL and meniscus injury is horrible news for the Brazilian and I'm sure all of us wish him a fast recovery. No one wants to see a player go through this.</p>\n<p>But can we talk about this social graphic from Neymar's club Al Hilal for a moment?</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>I am sure the club's social media team did not mean ill intent, but in an attempt to promote a post supporting your star player and his hopes to rehabilitate, it does seem a bit strange to specifically choose the one photograph where Neymar is at his most vulnerable, literally in agonizing pain. It's the one image he wants to completely forget.</p>\n<p>Maybe next time, be smarter in your photo selection, Al Hilal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final word</h2>\n<p>If you follow me on social media and know my work, it's no secret to you that I am a massive Bad Bunny fan. His new album is out and I thought I'd take this moment to salute its release as he mentions Messi many times! However, trust me, fam: it sounds better in Spanish!</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

We were concerned because Stones didn't play one minute in the last two months and then played for the national team. He was so important and we could not use him.</p>\n<p>\"We're happy he got minutes but what if he gets injured? So he plays some minutes and comes off. They love to play for their countries, and I never say not to go there. Thankfully everything was right and he's ready for the next games.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

It has also become an attractive league for star names -- <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a>, and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/24836/giorgio-chiellini\">Giorgio Chiellini</a> to name a few -- for which Dempsey and Drogba can be seen as trailblazers for this new movement.</p>\n<p>No team or player has arguably done more for that movement than <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>, who arrived this year.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> champion and seven-time Ballon d'Or winner's move to Inter Miami this summer has helped boost the league's popularity to unprecedented levels. Dempsey, 40, can appreciate the rise of interest in soccer in the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=660\">United States</a> with the arrival of the Argentine forward in Florida, which he believes has been a catalyst for allowing the sport to enter more of the mainstream for the American public.</p>\n<p>\"I would describe Messi coming to the States now in terms of what moves the needle,\" said Dempsey in an exclusive interview with ESPN at an EA Sports FC release party in New York City. \"Like in terms of the whole country, not just people who are soccer fans but the whole country when they pay attention and watch, it normally has to take a men's or women's World Cup, and with Messi coming in, he moves the needle like it's a World Cup.\"</p>\n<p>Messi has not only brought that level of attention with his talent on the pitch but off it as well. Ticket prices for Inter Miami matches have soared more than 1,000% with some prices in the secondary market going into the thousands for his matches in the league, while Messi jerseys on the online retailer Fanatics broke astronomical records. <a href=\"/soccer/story/_/id/37975000/lionel-messi-mls-apple-adidas-inter-miami\">According to Fanatics</a>, the first 24 hours of Messi jersey sales were the best 24 hours of any player changing teams across all sports.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi has enjoyed immediate success since arriving at Inter Miami in July, leading the team to their first-ever Leagues Cup title.\"></p>\n<p>The $2.5 billion deal with Apple TV has also been a huge part of bringing the Argentine star to the league, with Messi getting a cut of revenue as part of his contract, reportedly worth up to $150 million.</p>\n<p>Drogba also shares those same sentiments. He believes the opportunities given to him and Dempsey became the building blocks for the new generation of players and fans to experience what MLS has to offer. \"There are no regrets because I believe we built that, we were part of that,\" said Drogba.</p>\n<p>\"That's how life is. You build and you bring. You bring part of your experience to the game and the next generation can benefit from it.\"</p>\n<p>The success of the league has been instrumental in how the United States national team has evolved, as well.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Despite many big international names coming to ply their trade in MLS, the national team has also benefited from a mix of players who started their careers in the U.S. before making the jump abroad, as well as established players who have become stars in the league.</p>\n<p>That blend has helped the United States bounce back from its failure to qualify for the 2018 <a href=\"/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.world\">World Cup</a> in Russia, subsequently qualifying for the next one in Qatar while also returning some silverware in the CONCACAF <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/CONCACAF.GOLD\">Gold Cup</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/league/_/name/concacaf.nations.league\">Nations League</a>.</p>\n<p>Both men are confident for the 2026 World Cup, which will take place in the United States alongside <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=203\">Mexico</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=206\">Canada</a>. Dempsey views <a href=\"http://soccer/player/_/id/282643/folarin-balogun\">Folarin Balogun</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/289120/ricardo-pepi\">Ricardo Pepi</a> as the main names to lead the line in the attack for coach Gregg Berhalter.</p>\n<p>Both players also have had different trajectories to get to where they are now on Berhalter's team.</p>\n<p>Pepi started his career at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> at just 16 years old where he played for two years before making the jump to Europe playing for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=3841\">FC Augsburg</a> in Germany, where he became the most expensive American MLS player to sign for a European club following a $20 million transfer fee.</p>\n<p>The time in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1\">Bundesliga</a> did not work out as planned and after a loan spell at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=145\">FC Groningen</a>, he made the permanent switch to the Netherlands last summer currently playing for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=148\">PSV Eindhoven</a> with three goals in 11 matches to his name so far this season.</p>\n<p>Balogun on the other hand, was developed at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a>'s Hale End academy where he didn't get many opportunities to play for the first team. Following loan spells at <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/369/middlesbrough\">Middlesbrough</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/3243/stade-de-reims\">Reims</a>, he made the permanent switch last summer to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FRA.1\">Ligue 1</a> playing for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=174\">AS Monaco</a> where he has three goals in five matches so far for the Monégasques after making the one-time switch to play for the U.S.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi will be looking to achieve more success with the United States national team after winning the Concacaf Nations League in June.\"></p>\n<p>Dempsey, the joint all-time national team top goal scorer, believes the recent success of a round-of-16 finish at the 2022 World Cup and winning the 2023 Concacaf Nations League against Canada has only made them more competitive.</p>\n<p>\"From what I've been able to see from them playing on the national team, especially if you look at what happened in the Nations League, that was pretty impressive,\" said Dempsey.</p>\n<p>\"The performances they put in, and what I like most about Balogun is his ability to create chances for himself with the pace he has and the cutthroatiness he has in front of goal. I know there are going to be others that will come to the fray, but that's what you need to have if you want to have a top team, is to have competitions.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=4789\">Ivory Coast</a> international was also full of praise for the evolution of the infrastructure that the league has achieved ever since he left in 2016.</p>\n<p>\"I think the work that MLS has done in the United States and Canada has been great and this is just the next step,\" said Drogba.</p>\n<p>\"This is the preparation for the World Cup. The quality of the stadiums, the quality of the games has improved with these players coming.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo caption=\"Is Lionel Messi the best 36-year-old soccer player in the world? Read on for a breakdown of the best of the best, ages 16 to 36.\"></p>\n\n<p>There are all kinds of ways to define the best player in the world -- and we've <a href=\"/sports/insider/soccer/insider/story/_/id/35853769/who-best-men-player-world-soccer-right-now\">made</a> <a href=\"/soccer/insider/soccer/insider/story/_/id/35259622/lionel-messi-world-cup-proves-best-male-athlete-ever\">multiple</a> <a href=\"/soccer/insider/insider/story/_/id/37842117/world-class-soccer-players-explained\">attempts</a> at it on these <a href=\"/soccer/story/_/id/37906001/espn-fc-100-2023-haaland-mbappe-lead-best-men-players\">webpages</a>. Despite the impossibility of objectively measuring and then valuing everything that happens on a soccer field, there's still plenty of insight to be gleaned from the process.</p>\n\n<p>So, rather than changing how we're defining \"best,\" what if we changed <em>who</em> we're defining as the best? Might that reveal anything new about the current state of the soccer landscape? In an effort to find out, let's try to identify the best player in the world at every age -- from 16 through 36.</p>\n\n<p>There's no clear criteria for the best here but we'll be using a combination of how much better that player is than peers at his position <i>and</i> how valuable that position is. In other words, the third-best attacker would get the nod over the top goalkeeper.</p>\n\n<p>And as a guide, we'll be occasionally referring to a stat called \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/InvisibleGoals/status/1687516411126566916\" target=\"_blank\">Contextualized Plus-Minus</a>,\" or CPM, which was created by the analyst <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InvisibleGoals\" target=\"_blank\">Edvin Tran Hoac</a>. The statistic looks at a combination of individual on-ball statistics and how teams perform with these players on and off the field, then it estimates the impact that player would have on overall team performance. That approach, ideally, captures both the measurable impact of a player from things like shots and passes and also the not-yet-measurable impact he might have on winning.</p>\n\n<p>As the line from British statistician George Box goes, \"All models are wrong, some are useful.\" CPM is certainly useful. So let's get to it.</p>\n\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/362150/lamine-yamal\">Lamine Yamal</a>, forward, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>He turned 16 years old in mid-July and over his past 600-ish minutes in LaLiga and Champions League, he ranks in the 98th percentile for non-penalty expected goals plus expected assists per 90 minutes and in the 98th percentile for touches inside the penalty area among wingers across the Big Five leagues.</p>\n\n<p>If you simply play at all -- terribly, incredibly, whatever -- for a team like Barcelona at 16, you're likely headed for big things. Yamal, instead, is <i>already</i> doing big things. I can't believe I'm already saying this with any degree of confidence, but he might be the next <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/173896/mohamed-salah\">Mohamed Salah</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><video1></p>\n\n\n<h2>17: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/345581/warren-zaire-emery\">Warren Zaire-Emery</a>, midfielder, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, he became the youngest player to start a Champions League game -- in the round of 16 against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a>. This season, he's played the third-most minutes of any PSG outfield player. He hasn't quite affected matches like Yamal has -- not a ton of incisive passing or ball-winning -- but he never loses the ball. Everything else seems likely to come with time. He was born in 2006, a year after the popular video platform YouTube was created.</p>\n\n<p>Per CPM, the highest-rated 17-year-old is Lenny Yoro, the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=166\">Lille</a> center back who has already played more than 1,200 professional minutes. Good for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=478\">France</a>. I was getting worried there for a minute. It's been a couple of weeks since they've had a promising young center back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>18: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/289645/evan-ferguson\">Evan Ferguson</a>, forward, Brighton</h2>\n\n\n<p>Since the start of last season, Ferguson ranks ninth in non-penalty xG+xA (that is, expected goals plus expected assists) per 90 minutes among all <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a> players with at least 1,200 minutes.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1013/r1238104_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>The average age of the eight players ahead of him is north of 27, and he won't be that old until 2031. Don't be shocked if this guy eventually challenges for a Ballon d'Or.</p>\n\n\n<h2>19: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/323702/gavi\">Gavi</a>, midfielder, Barcelona</h2>\n\n\n<p>Although it might seem like it, this wasn't an easy selection given the other 19-year-olds who are already performing at a high level.</p>\n<p>Barcelona's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/323703/alejandro-balde\">Alejandro Balde</a> has played more than 3,000 minutes as a pro. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/308217/romeo-lavia\">Romeo Lavia</a> just spent a whole season as a starter at maybe the most demanding position (defensive midfielder) in the most demanding league (Premier League) in the world. <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=1929\">Benfica</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/346588/antonio-silva\">António Silva</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=105\">Atalanta</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/309812/giorgio-scalvini\">Giorgio Scalvini</a> have both racked up a ton of minutes at a position (center back) where players peak later into their 20s. And <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/20975/julio-enciso\">Julio Enciso</a> looked like another budding star at Brighton before he got hurt at the beginning of the season.</p>\n\n\n<p>CPM favors Silva, but rather than overcomplicating matters, we're just going with the guy who's now in his <i>third</i> year as a near full-time starter at Barcelona.</p>\n\n\n<h2>20: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/291281/jude-bellingham\">Jude Bellingham</a>, midfielder, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a></h2>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/250465/pedri\">Pedri</a> in Barcelona <i>might</i> have an argument were he able to stay healthy, but Bellingham is staking a claim as the best player in the world, let alone the best player at his age. Eight games into his Real Madrid career, he's scored more LaLiga goals than <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/22774/cristiano-ronaldo\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> had at the same stage. Bellingham, of course, is still only 20 and technically plays as a midfielder.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, he's basically a No. 10 at this point, but he's still doing a little bit of everything else -- ball-winning, passing (leading the team in through balls!), off-ball running -- in addition to scoring an absurd number of goals.</p>\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n<p>On top of all the clear value he provides on the field, he also makes it really easy to build out the rest of the team. He wasn't expected to be a goal-scoring No. 10 before the season, but Real Madrid need him to be a goal-scoring No. 10, so he is. Rather than chasing players in specific positions, Madrid can sign whoever they want -- and Bellingham will fill in the gaps.</p>\n\n\n<h2>21: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/299910/josko-gvardiol\">Josko Gvardiol</a>, center back, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>It's funny how these things shake out. At 20, there's Pedri, Bellingham, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/303821/jamal-musiala\">Jamal Musiala</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/303748/florian-wirtz\">Florian Wirtz</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/332962/xavi-simons\">Xavi Simons</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/285150/eduardo-camavinga\">Eduardo Camavinga</a>. At 21, it's Gvardiol -- and not much else. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/289877/moises-caicedo\">Moisés Caicedo</a> was an expensive player, but we've still really only seen one season of high-level performance from him.</p>\n<p>Gvardiol was starting for a Champions League team at 19, and now he's starting for the best team in the world. Doing all of that is rare enough, but doing it at center back almost never happens.</p>\n\n\n<h2>22: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/280555/bukayo-saka\">Bukayo Saka</a>, forward, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>Let's remember some guys who are only 22 and already among the best players in the world: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/267804/rodrygo\">Rodrygo</a>, Saka, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/285450/enzo-fernandez\">Enzo Fernández</a>, Kvicha Kvaratshkelia, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/269844/gabriel-martinelli\">Gabriel Martinelli</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/257206/dominik-szoboszlai\">Dominik Szoboszlai</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/236721/alphonso-davies\">Alphonso Davies</a>. For whatever reason, both the 20 and 22 age groups are stacked, while (at least for now) the age 21 group is lacking. I have no cute theories to explain that -- it's just random, man.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I come down to Enzo and Saka for this slot. Unlike some of the previously mentioned players, Saka has never quite put up superstar attacking numbers. His career-best non-penalty goals+assists-per-90-minutes mark was last season's 0.65, which ranked 14th in the Premier League. Enzo, meanwhile, has basically been lights out since he entered the league. How that shows up statistically: elite forward passing, elite pass completion and great ball-winning. That's the whole game -- and that's why CPM rates him first.</p>\n\n\n<p>Saka, though, is second, and when you adjust for minutes played -- looking at how much value they provided in the past compared to their forward-looking projection -- he moves into first. There is, however, a question over whether he's played <i>too much</i>:</p>\n\n\n<p><inline2> </p>\n\n\n<p>Let's hope not. Saka's performance has steadily performed year after year, and even without the elite production getting awarded to his name, there's clearly a massive amount of gravity to his game. The entire opposition has to shift toward his side of the field, which opens up so much space for everyone else.</p>\n\n\n<h2>23: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/253989/erling-haaland\">Erling Haaland</a>, forward, Manchester City</h2>\n\n\n<p>Next!</p>\n\n\n<h2>24. <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe\">Kylian Mbappé</a>, forward, Paris Saint-Germain</h2>\n\n\n<p>Next!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>25: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/223532/trent-alexander-arnold\">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, fullback, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=364\">Liverpool</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>He's been the engine of both ball progression and creativity for one of the five best teams in the world for the past half a decade. We already have proof that you can win <i>every</i> trophy with him doing those things -- and that was all before he even entered his prime.</p>\n\n<p>These are all his passes worth at least 0.05 expected assists:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1013/r1238116_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n<p>While there was plenty of consternation about his defensive ability during the last campaign, Liverpool went on their late-season tear as soon as they decided to adopt the new strategy of \"just let TAA touch the ball as many times as possible.\"</p>\n\n<p>The other contenders here are Newcastle's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/218522/bruno-guimaraes\">Bruno Guimarães</a> and Real Madrid's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/235818/federico-valverde\">Federico Valverde</a>, but neither one can match the longevity and consistency of TAA's impact <i>or</i> the high-end of his impact, when he just decides games on his own. He's the leader, among 25-year-olds, in CPM -- but he also turned 25 just a couple of days ago. If I wrote this article last month, he might not have even been mentioned.</p>\n\n\n<h2>26: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/157688/kim-min-jae\">Kim Min-Jae</a>, center back, Bayern Munich</h2>\n\n\n<p>This is a tricky one, but we're going to go with the only 26-year-old who could reasonably be considered the best in the world at his position.</p>\n\n<p>Frenkie De Jong and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/204441/nicolo-barella\">Nicolò Barella</a> are both fantastic modern eights, who do a little bit of everything on the field but have their sliders turned up toward an attacking impact around the box. They just both feel like secondary players, rather than transformative ones.</p>\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n<p>The case against Kim is that he's only on his second season in the Big Five leagues. Are we overvaluing one lights out season in <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=114\">Napoli</a> and are we crediting him too much for simply being on the same team as <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/228296/victor-osimhen\">Victor Osimhen</a> and Kvaratshkelia? Perhaps, but we're opting for the potential that he'll be one of the best CBs in the world for the next five years over the more known outcomes we'd get from Barella and De Jong. CPM puts De Jong first, Kim second and Barella third.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>27: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/231828/rodri\">Rodri</a>, midfielder, Manchester City</h2>\n\n\n<p>I <i>really</i> wanted to throw Stuttgart's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/186381/serhou-guirassy\">Serhou Guirassy</a> on here, and I'm not totally sure that I <i>shouldn't</i> throw Stuttgart's Serhou Guirassy on here. Through seven games, the guy has <a href=\"https://theanalyst.com/eu/2023/10/serhou-guirassy-the-record-breaker/\" target=\"_blank\">more goals than any player</a> ... in the history of the freaking <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1\">Bundesliga</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1013/r1238123_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n<p>He's not going to keep scoring over 40% of his shots, but he's still leading all players across the Big Five leagues in expected goals plus expected assists -- despite the Bundesliga playing at least one fewer game than the four other leagues. This came from out of nowhere, but he's been so dominant that he now ranks second in CPM among all 27-year-olds.</p>\n<p>First, though, is Rodri. If some all-knowing entity were able to create an all-in-one statistic that perfectly calculated and then valued every little movement that happened on a soccer field, with and without the ball, I'm not sure that Rodri wouldn't come out rated No. 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>28: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/190161/joshua-kimmich\">Joshua Kimmich</a>, midfielder, Bayern Munich</h2>\n\n\n<p>To sum it up, simply: Kimmich has led the Bundesliga in progressive passes in each of the four previous full seasons, and he's leading the league again this year.</p>\n<p>Bayern manager Thomas Tuchel might not view him as a true holding midfielder, but there might not be anyone in the world who's better at moving the ball. And Kimmich does it over and over and over. Per CPM, he's the fifth-most valuable player in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>29: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/124091/bruno-fernandes\">Bruno Fernandes</a>, attacking midfielder, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=360\">Manchester United</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>Although his teammates have only converted them into nine goals, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/158601/bruno\">Bruno</a>'s passes over the past season-plus have added up to 13.8 expected assists -- fourth-most of any player across the Big Five leagues. He's attempted 114 shots -- only 13 other players have taken more. He's completed 167 passes into the penalty area -- only three players have made more. And the combined xG value of every uninterrupted possession he's been involved in adds up to 45.13 -- more than all but four players.</p>\n<p>In other words, if Manchester United ever move the ball or generate a chance on goal, it's likely because of Fernandes. While there are questions about how he'd scale on a better team where he wouldn't get as much of the ball, it's scary to think of where United might be if it weren't for him.</p>\n\n\n<h2>30: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/142200/harry-kane\">Harry Kane</a>, forward, Bayern Munich</h2>\n\n\n<p>According to CPM, the most impactful 30-year-old in the world is Napoli's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/155904/giovanni-di-lorenzo\">Giovanni Di Lorenzo</a>. He's a fantastic fullback and one of the truly underrated players in European soccer. He's the kind of player who's good at everything, but not in any kind of obvious way. That adds up to a sort of hidden, outsized impact on winning. Whatever situation he's in -- against a packed-in defense, forced to defend deep, competing in an end-to-end track meet -- he's able to contribute something valuable. He's always helping his team win, and he rarely misses any matches -- that's what CPM is picking up on.</p>\n\n\n<p>That said, Harry Kane has scored 30 non-penalty goals since the start of last season. Only Haaland and Mbappe have more. <i>He's</i> the best 30-year-old in the world.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n\n\n<h2>31: Mohamed Salah, forward, Liverpool</h2>\n\n\n<p>This comes down to two players on the same team: Salah and Alisson.</p>\n<p>The gap between Alisson and the next best goalkeeper in the world might be bigger than at any other position. He's just so good at every aspect of goalkeeping, and with Liverpool's style of play, he's constantly being asked to save some of the toughest shots faced by any keeper in Europe. By CPM, he's the best player in the world at this age.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, though, we're going with Salah, who might be the best Premier League attacker not named Thierry Henry.</p>\n\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n<p>While Salah's non-penalty-xG-per-90 rate this season is the lowest it's been in his Liverpool career (0.35), he's more than doubled his career xA rate at Liverpool (0.56). He's leading the Premier League in expected assists (4.2) this season.</p>\n<p>As Salah has aged deeper into his 30s, has he found a way to tweak his game to maintain his world-class impact? This season, the answer is yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>32: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/134947/kevin-de-bruyne\">Kevin De Bruyne</a>, attacking midfielder, Manchester City</h2>\n\n\n<p>He's played 22 minutes this season, and yet he still leads all players in Europe with 14.29 expected assists since the start of last season.</p>\n\n<p>Going back to 1995, a group of European journalists <a href=\"https://www.espn.in/sports/insider/soccer/insider/story/_/id/34177626/the-lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-era-how-work-best-players-world\" target=\"_blank\">have been selecting</a> a Team of the Month. The most selections are <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>'s 88. Second most: Cristiano Ronaldo with 51. Third: Roberto Carlos with 34. And then tied for fourth with 31 are <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/30901/dani-alves\">Dani Alves</a> and De Bruyne.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not he ever regains his previous form whenever he returns from his hamstring injury, KDB should go down as one of the greatest midfielders to play the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>33: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/143637/kieran-trippier\">Kieran Trippier</a>, fullback, Newcastle</h2>\n\n\n<p>Since the start of last season, Tripper has completed 272 passes into the opposition penalty area. No one else has completed more than 186.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1013/r1238127_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p>So, Newcastle just probably are an elite team at this point. Yes, they've lost three matches in the league already, but they smoked Paris Saint-Germain and they've played arguably the toughest schedule in the Premier League. Despite that, they still have the second-best non-penalty xG differential at even strength in <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=448\">England</a>.</p>\n<p>When you look at Newcastle's roster -- still composed of a bunch of players from the team that was nearly relegated -- it's really difficult to understand how that can be. But once you accept that Trippier might be one of the best players in the world -- better than anyone else at moving the ball into the most dangerous area of the field -- then you at least get somewhere toward an explanation. Per CPM, he's one of the five most valuable players in the world.</p>\n<p>Obligatory <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/103173/toni-kroos\">Toni Kroos</a> mention: He, too, remains fantastic.</p>\n\n\n<h2>34: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121020/dani-parejo\">Dani Parejo</a>, midfielder, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=102\">Villarreal</a></h2>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/84627/mats-hummels\">Mats Hummels</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/123465/thomas-muller\">Thomas Müller</a> were also in contention here, but neither one plays enough minutes. Among players currently 34 or older, only two other performers have registered more domestic minutes than Parejo's 4,003 since the start of last season.</p>\n\n<p>His defensive impact has steadily declined -- 3.66 tackles+interceptions per 90 at his peak, 1.52 this season -- but he still rates above the 80th percentile among all midfielders for passes attempted, passes completed and progressive passes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>35: <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/125824/robert-lewandowski\">Robert Lewandowski</a>, forward, Barcelona</h2>\n\n\n<p>Since 2010, Lewandowski has scored 299 non-penalty goals in the Big Five leagues. That's the most among all players in the non-Messi-or-Ronaldo division, and that gap is only going to grow. The guys directly behind him -- <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/272722/luis-suarez\">Luis Suárez</a> (234) and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/46858/karim-benzema\">Karim Benzema</a> (205) -- seem to have left European soccer for good. Since turning 30, Lewandowski has never scored fewer than 23 non-penalty goals in a season, and he's on a similar production pace again this season. By dominating so deep into his 30s, he's probably established himself as the best center forward of his generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>36: Lionel Messi, forward, Inter Miami</h2>\n\n\n<p>He hasn't played a game on the continent since the beginning of June, and he's still leading all of Europe in expected assists since the start of last season. Were you expecting anyone else?</p>",

Messi hit the post with a free kick in second-half stoppage time, but the hosts were unable to extend the lead after he came into the game.</p>\n<p>\"I'm happy to be playing again ... It is always difficult to enter from the bench and even more so in such a tight game,\" Messi said. \"The important thing is that we won, and we played well, especially in the first half.</p>\n<p>\"I come here after playing only a few minutes for my club [<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/20232/inter-miami-cf\">Inter Miami CF</a>].

At this point, I'm not ruling out any option. He could play from the start, as a substitute or not playing at all.</p>\n<p>\"But today I think it was risky for him to get a lot of playing time.

You'd need 10 Taylor Swifts visiting Travis Kelce and the Chiefs to understand just how big July and August were in American sports media as soon as Messi took over and arrived in Fort Lauderdale.</p>\n<p>I think the series does a good job at chronicling the magnitude of the moment, but in the first episode, Beckham, who made his own volcano-like announcement in 2007 when he signed for the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=187\">LA Galaxy</a> thus changing the landscape of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> forever, does specifically well to explain what Messi's arrival to America means to everyone, not just Inter Miami fans.</p>\n<p>\"We made this decision to bring Leo to Miami, not just for us, not just for our fans,\" Beckham said. \"But we did it for the league, we did it for the sport and we did it for America.\"</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>Beckham was instrumental in Messi's arrival. Not so much in the specific, logistical aspects (that was Jorge Mas' job, who did a lot of legwork to make this happen) but in making sure Messi understood the environment he was arriving in.</p>\n<p>\"He guided me and told me a little bit about his experience,\" explains Messi in the first episode. \"What it had been for him to come and play here. When he made the decision, but at the same time he told me that things now were not the same because the league had grown a lot since his arrival.\"</p>\n<p>Without Becks -- in more ways than one -- there would be no Messi in MLS. Pure and simple.</p>\n<h3>Messi's impact on the squad</h3>\n<p>Having this kind of documentary is beneficial for staff and squad access and how much Messi has impacted the entire setup. I liked how many voices from Inter Miami are featured heavily, including Tata Martino. There's a great scene when the Argentinian manager -- who has managed <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a>, three national teams and 2018 MLS Cup winners Atlanta United -- is entering the training facilities for the first time and the security guard asks him, \"Who are you?\" and Tata with a smile replies, \"I'm the coach!\"</p>\n<p>Many first-team players are featured including <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a>, as well as young academy graduates and Miami-born <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/229289/david-ruiz\">David Ruiz</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/356358/benjamin-cremaschi\">Benjamin Cremaschi</a>, who give us some really nice moments with their respective families, explaining what playing next to Messi feels like. The scene with Cremaschi eating with his father Pablo -- who played rugby with the Argentinian national team -- is especially touching.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>My favorite, however, is <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/183778/deandre-yedlin\">DeAndre Yedlin</a>. Anyone who has interviewed Yedlin can tell you the same thing. He gives excellent stories and quotes. Throughout the series, he explains in detail the significance of having Messi as a teammate.</p>\n<p>\"It's an extra motivation to raise my game,\" says Yedlin, as he talks during the scenes of Messi's debut against Cruz Azul back in July 21 at DRV PNK stadium. \"How close to Messi's level can I get? That's the pinnacle of the sport.\"</p>\n<p>Yedlin gives a great anecdote in that game, when it's tied at 1-1 and Messi earns a free-kick in stoppage time. \"I went over to the sideline and told Tata and said that my hamstrings are cramping,\" he recalls. \"But Tata says, 'Don't worry. Leo will score this and then we'll go inside and it will be finished.' I was like 'okay.'\"</p>\n<p>And that's exactly what happened. The highlights of the Leagues Cup tournament really seemed cinematic, almost unbelievable, all the way through to the final, which was won on penalties against Nashville. The doc does a good job at reliving all those moments and seeing how Inter Miami, as a team, completely transformed upon Messi's arrival. It was a historic competition for the club and as Beckham said earlier in the doc, the significance of it was not only for Inter Miami.</p>\n<h3>Messi and the Latino community</h3>\n\n\n<p>The first three episodes also do a good job at illustrating the community around the club, and this is an important component, arguably the most important after Messi himself. We meet local business owners and soccer fans -- from Dallas to Philadelphia -- explaining what Messi's arrival means to them. Here is where the Latino audience is especially important because to the Latin American community, especially the immigrant Latino community in America, Messi is not just a superstar player, he is a symbol of Latin American pride. It goes beyond Argentinians.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone here's going to want to give Messi nonstop hugs, all the Hispanics, because we are all Messi\" says Ezequiel Sierra Núñez, a butcher at La Suprema Market's Mexican restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Núnéz paid $800 to see Messi play when Inter Miami traveled to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> on Aug. 7 in the round of 16 of the Leagues Cup. \"A thousand [dollars] would be nothing for me to go see Messi,\" he said. </p>\n<p>\"For people who are Argentinian or Latin American, Messi is a huge symbol of our culture,\" explains Eva Raggio, a reporter for Dallas Observer. \"If we had a Mount Rushmore, he would be on it. There's this uniting factor, which is soccer and Messi. It's a huge factor of South American culture. You always feel a little less isolated, only as you tend to do when you're an immigrant from another country.\"</p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>OFFSIDE</h2>\n<h3>It often feels like a promotional campaign</h3>\n<p>One of the issues with these types of docu-series projects -- from \"All or Nothing\" to \"Welcome to Wrexham\" -- is that it often can't escape from the luring desire to turn an honest story into an advertising campaign. And this is what sometimes happens here in Messi Meets America.</p>\n<p>I mean, I get it. This is a product, it's not just a series, and it has to be maximized. But I think the best documentaries work when they show you all sides of the proverbial coin, when it completely peels all the onion and tells you a human story. It's why \"Sunderland Til' I Die\" and Asif Kapadia's \"Maradona\" work so well. Because they show the viewer the beautiful and the ugly side of this world, the cheerful and the painful, and in the end, that's what we all are. None of us are perfect and documentaries need to reflect that.</p>\n<p>In this particular scenario, I would have liked to have seen more behind-the-scenes moments of Messi's first few weeks in Miami, especially with his wife Antonela Roccuzzo, who was pivotal in this decision to come to South Florida.</p>\n<p>Was she anxious about yet another move? Especially after the two years at PSG that did not go to plan. How about the kids and how the family deals with the overwhelming paparazzi and media attention? Are they ready for yet another switch to a new country? Was there a worry from anyone over at MLS that Messi's signing was doing a lot -- perhaps too much -- at focusing on just him as he was taking way too much of the pie?</p>\n<p>I would have liked to have seen intimate moments with Messi away from the club, from the training ground and interviews. He is a composed, humble player who just happens to be the greatest player the game has ever seen. But what is he like at home? I think there was a lot that could have been done to show you the vulnerable aspects of this story.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we will see that in the next episodes as the doc dives into his absence due to injury, losing the U.S. Open Cup and the club's inability to make the MLS playoffs. There are also the questions over next season's ticket sales and how they have doubled in price. How do Inter Miami's loyal fans, who were there before Messi and will be there after, feel about it? There's a lot more to unpack.</p>\n<p><video4></p>\n<h3>Wanted more from Fort Lauderdale and Inter Miami community</h3>\n<p>Carrying on with that sentiment, I wanted to see more of Miami and Fort Lauderdale because this is a community, especially Fort Lauderdale, that is hugely impacted by Messi's arrival.</p>\n<p>Is there anyone there who doesn't know who he is? Are there worries about what happens when he doesn't play? Do Inter Miami fans worry that Messi is now attracting the wrong type of fan, the one who is here only for Messi and nothing else?</p>\n<p>How about ticket sale prices? The secondary market is one thing but clubs surely have to do better to make sure they're not just inflating the prices due to one player, even if it is Messi. It's why I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37994023/miami-fans-stars-share-messi-mls-debut-anticipation-2023\">wrote this piece</a> before he even arrived. It was important for me to hear about the community and how they felt about Messi's introduction to South Florida. I think the documentary needs a bit more of it, too.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final word</h2>\n<p>As mentioned in the introduction of this week's column, here at ESPN we covered Messi's summer of madness extensively and I was there to see it. The documentary exemplifies what it meant to be there and see with our own eyes the incredible impact Messi had on America, not just Inter Miami.</p>\n<p>Right before the Leagues Cup, we talked to the man himself about the move and his thoughts on MLS and soccer's presence and growth in the U.S.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla, -- After missing five of the past six games with a hamstring injury, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> returned to action Saturday, playing 35 minutes off the bench in a 1-0 loss to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> that eliminated <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/20232/inter-miami-cf\">Inter Miami</a> from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> postseason contention.</p>\n<p>Messi's only real contributions came when he sailed two free kicks -- one in the the 58th minute, the other in stoppage time -- well over Cincinnati goalkeeper <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/315972/roman-celentano\">Roman Celentano</a>'s crossbar.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<p>\"His injury is healed, but his rhythm was just off. He hasn't played much, that's why I only played him 35 minutes,\" said coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino.</p>\n<p>The 36-year-old Argentine legend -- who played more centrally in this game than he had in previous outings for Inter Miami -- had managed just 37 minutes in one appearance over the past six games coming into Saturday, with Miami winning just once while Messi was absent.</p>\n<p>Messi will now depart for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> qualifying duty with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> in the coming days. The World Cup champion has a home game on Thursday against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=210\">Paraguay</a> before traveling to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=211\">Peru</a> on Oct. 17.</p>\n<p>It was while on international duty that Messi picked up the injury that ultimately proved fatal to Miami's playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>He will miss Miami's next game on Oct.18, a rescheduled contest with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a>, but could be back in the squad for the rematch in North Carolina three days later on the final day of the regular season.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>However, with Miami now playing for nothing more than pride, and Messi's health at less-than-ideal levels, it's questionable whether Messi will dress in pink again this season.</p>\n<p>Martino said he won't let the final two contests go to waste, however.</p>\n<p>\"It is very important the assessment we can do in these remaining games to make the best decisions for next year,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Messi has 11 goals in 13 matches with Inter Miami. It is 8-1-4 when he plays; seven of those matches were on the team's run to winning its first trophy by claiming the Leagues Cup, and another was in the U.S. Open Cup semifinal. Inter Miami is 1-3-2 in its six matches without Messi since he joined the club.</p>\n<p>Saturday's loss, along with wins by several teams above Miami in the table, left the South Florida side seven points adrift of the final playoff spot with only two games remaining.</p>\n<p>\"I'm satisfied with that we've done,\" said Martino, who was upbeat in the postgame news conference despite his team being eliminated.</p>\n<p>\"I always thought from the moment I took over the team that these six months were going to be about giving the team some shape, getting it ready for 2024.</p>\n<p>\"We were able to win a title, something 26 of 28 teams won't do this season, and we had the chance to make the playoffs, which three months ago was impossible to think of, so I'm happy with the way we competed.\"</p>\n<p>In a matchup with the league's best team and already-crowned Supporters' Shield winners at a rainy DRV PNK Stadium, Miami hit the woodwork three times in the first 24 minutes of an entertaining first half. Goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/245083/drake-callender\">Drake Callender</a> made several superb saves throughout the game to keep his side in the contest.</p>\n<p>In an unusual move, Messi did not join the rest of his teammates in the 18-man squad for pregame warm-ups. Instead, he emerged from the tunnel and took his seat on the bench just before the start of the national anthem.</p>\n<p>He also did not warm up with the rest of the Miami substitutes toward the end of the first half or at halftime, but did finally get off his seat in the opening moments of the second half to get limber in front of a subdued <em>La Familia</em> supporters' group section.</p>\n<p>Miami's most fervent supporters mostly kept their word regarding their planned protest of the higher 2024 season ticket renewal prices.</p>\n<p>After initially saying they would boycott the match completely, they agreed to attend the game following a meeting with the team, but without flags or instruments.</p>\n<p>They didn't quite manage to stick completely to their word, with a couple of flags waving and drums banged intermittently during 90 minutes that saw Miami's memorable season end on a damp note.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

The team is 8-0-4 when he plays; seven of those matches were on the team's run to win its first-ever trophy by claiming the Leagues Cup -- the irony of that run being that it prompted concerns over how much Messi was being asked to play in a relatively short span after joining his new club. He has appeared in four MLS matches and one U.S. Open Cup semifinal.</p>\n<p>The team entered Saturday 1-2-1 in its four matches without Messi since signing the legend.

The remainder of the schedule suggests as much.</p>\n<p>After NYCFC, Inter Miami goes up against a <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/182/chicago-fire-fc\">Chicago Fire</a> side that hasn't won since before Leagues Cup, so logic dictates that three points are very attainable there.</p>\n<p>But it is three days later, Oct. 7, that dictates this entire playoff-seeking exercise for Inter Miami. That's when Supporters' Shield leader <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> comes to town, and no question that Cincy's players would love nothing more than to avenge their U.S. Open Cup semifinal penalty shootout defeat with a resounding win in Fort Lauderdale, possibly even winning the Supporters' Shield in the process.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"It's unclear if Lionel Messi will play again for Inter Miami before the playoffs, but Miami might have a hard time reaching the postseason without him.\"></p>\n<p>Basically, if Miami head coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino wanted to go full NBA and \"schedule a loss\" for the sake of rest, this is the one to do it. To reach the 43-point threshold, though, this would be the only loss Miami could afford.</p>\n<p>What then follows are Miami's final two games of the season, and in a curious twist, they will be a pair of meetings with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a>, a team that only joined MLS last year, missing the playoffs.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Adding uncertainty is that the first match against Charlotte takes place in Florida on Oct. 18, just one day after Argentina is scheduled to be in Lima to play <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=211\">Peru</a> in a CONMEBOL World Cup qualifier. Messi's availability for anything, whether Inter Miami or <em>Albiceleste</em>, is unknown, but his inkling is to always be with his national team, no matter what.</p>\n<p>That will have to be hashed out by Messi, Martino and Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni, but from the Inter Miami perspective, those are three points that have to be pocketed. Doing it without Messi would be all the more difficult, but if the loss in Cincinnati transpires, this Charlotte game is a must-win.</p>\n<p>Finally, MLS Decision Day will arrive three days later on Oct. 21 to close out the regular season, and if Inter Miami had gotten the necessary results and Messi's health is good, it just might be the first time Messi gets a taste of an MLS specialty: flying black pellets on an artificial turf field.</p>\n<p>The second date with Charlotte will be away at Bank of America Stadium, fake grass and all. For a Miami team that has been battling fatigue in recent weeks and its star not at 100%, this will be a test of mettle to come away with a full three points. That is all assuming Inter Miami can even get to the final day of the regular season with a chance at reaching the playoffs, of course.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of work to do, beginning on Saturday against NYCFC. With Messi's injury quandary, fatigue settling into the team, an upcoming schedule with a behemoth like FC Cincinnati and the curveball of the international window, the journey north of the 43-point playoff line leaves almost no room for error.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>Things just aren't the same when you can't rely on arguably the greatest soccer player of all time. With Argentine superstar and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a>-winner <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> left off the gameday roster due to a muscle injury, <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/20232/inter-miami-cf\">Inter Miami</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38507541/lionel-messi-play-inter-miami-open-cup-final\">slumped to a 2-1 home loss against</a> the <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/6077/houston-dynamo-fc\">Houston Dynamo</a> in Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup final.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<p>Messi, looking somber and melancholic when the camera cut to him in the stands after the final whistle, could do little else but watch as his team failed to find a way to compensate for his gargantuan absence. Coupled with an additional injury for key figure <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a>, Miami were listless during a majority of the championship game.</p>\n<p>Houston, likely galvanized by the news that Messi would be unavailable, were by far the more proactive of the two teams in the start to the final. Ambitious and enthusiastic, the Dynamo constantly pressed forward and were dominant with their attacking momentum that led to two goals within the first 33 minutes from <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/267116/griffin-dorsey\">Griffin Dorsey</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/255910/amine-bassi\">Amine Bassi</a>.</p>\n<p>Miami, in comparison, were lost in the early stages. The lack of their Argentine focal point also led to a lack of cohesion. The Florida club were sloppy with possession, fragile in defensive transition, and also poor with many of their mistimed crosses.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>No Messi available to conduct things going forward, Miami didn't manage to create a single shot until the 42nd minute. Up top, striker <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/284834/leonardo-campana\">Leonardo Campana</a> appeared isolated throughout the first half.</p>\n<p>The slight silver lining for manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino and his men is that things improved in the second half, although it was too little too late. Through the addition of a more energetic striker like <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/172688/josef-martinez\">Josef Martínez</a> (among other substitutions) into the mix, Miami began to create more chances in the final third and eventually claimed their lone goal in the 92nd minute from Martinez.</p>\n<p>That said, that goal would eventually go down as a consolation prize. Unable to find the back of the net a second time, Miami stumbled to a 2-1 loss that highlighted problems in not only Wednesday's championship game, but also going forward as they attempt a late season sprint into the MLS Cup playoffs.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>There are no guarantees about Messi bouncing back quickly either.</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't wise for him to play [today], that's clear. Not even considering for a few minutes because we would be taking risks,\" said Martino in the post-game press conference about Messi's injury. \"He'll surely play before the league ends...[but] we'll go game by game defining the situation to see when the medical staff tell us that he's fit to play without running risks.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the small sample size, it's no surprise that Miami don't play at the same level without Messi. Since arriving to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> in the summer, the 36-year-old has maintained an undefeated record in the 12 games in all competitions for Miami that he's been featured in. Along the way, he's racked up a Leagues Cup title and a stunning total of 11 goals and eight assists.</p>\n<p>Without Messi, Martino and his players have only been able to clinch one win -- a narrow 3-2 result over <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=186\">Sporting Kansas City</a> -- in the four matches he has been unavailable. In fact, when Messi (and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a> and Alba) arrived midseason, Miami were last in MLS' Eastern Conference table.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The immediate boost that Messi provided was a brilliantly dramatic one after winning the Leagues Cup and giving Miami a fighting chance to qualify for the playoffs, but their hopes can still implode during their final five matches of the regular season. Tired and drained, a long list of minutes and games have become a severe hurdle for Martino's players. Even with blockbuster summer additions to Miami's roster, the sheer number of games were going to catch up with the squad that played 16 matches across three competitions in 68 days.</p>\n<p>\"It's true that at the beginning we began to have a team that offered answers, but we were much fresher physically. The number of games hadn't been accumulated, the number of decisive games hadn't been accumulated,\" stated Martino.</p>\n<p>The remaining path ahead won't be easy. Even if Messi and Alba recover immediately, Miami will still need to go through a grueling run through their final five MLS regular season matches in 22 days. Of those five clashes, one will be against league-leaders <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> and two will require away trips to Chicago and Charlotte.</p>\n<p>Attempting to recover from their U.S. Open Cup loss, Miami will also have little room for error. Although they're just five points behind a playoff spot within the top nine of the Eastern Conference, all but one team remain ahead of them in the standings. Adding extra mileage and playing time in a short period of time likely won't help the group that appeared fatigued as soon as Wednesday's final started.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>\"What I saw is a worn-out team, that's the reality,\" said Martino. \"At some point we were going to start suffering the consequences of so many games.\"</p>\n<p>And those games have impacted their biggest star and figure in a crucial period.</p>\n<p>A couple months back when Messi first arrived in Miami to much fanfare, the soccer gods at first seemed to look kindly onto the player and his new team. Kicking things off with a Hollywood script-worthy game-winning goal in injury time during his debut in July's Leagues Cup, which paved the path to an eventual trophy in the tournament, a fairy tale in American soccer began to be written as the living legend significantly rejuvenated the team that had once been dead last in MLS.</p>\n<p>Confidence, swagger and determination followed as Miami claimed win after win with Messi guiding the way, but as seen in recent days, the near-divine sporting being is still a human one. Needing a rest after the international break earlier this month when he traveled and scored for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> in World Cup qualifiers, the veteran wasn't able to rediscover his full fitness with Miami upon return.</p>\n<p>By Sept. 20, things took a turn after he needed to be <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38449610/lionel-messi-jordi-alba-leave-inter-miami-game-toronto\">substituted out in the 37th minute of a match</a> against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=7318\">Toronto FC</a>. Slowly walking off the pitch after being unable to continue playing, it was a stark reminder that the aging soccer celebrity isn't immune to exhaustion or physical setbacks.</p>\n<p>Messi is expected to return to play in Miami's final stretch in the race to the playoffs, but we still don't know what role he'll have or the minutes he'll earn in the regular season's impending finish. What we do know, as seen on Wednesday and recent games, is that Miami aren't the same without him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>In arguably the biggest sports deal in American history, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/Lionel-Messi\">Lionel Messi</a>'s move to <a href=\"/soccer/league/_/name/usa.1\">Major League Soccer</a> is seismic for the sport's growth in the U.S. The superstar will face a new challenge at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a> after winning numerous club trophies at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, as well as international titles such as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, Messi's Miami era couldn't have started any better. In less than two months, he's already helped them win one title (the Leagues Cup tournament that featured all MLS and Liga MX teams). Miami also made the final of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/usa.open\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Open Cup</a> but fell <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/story/_/id/38507541/lionel-messi-play-inter-miami-open-cup-final\" target=\"_blank\">2-1</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/team?id=6077\" target=\"_blank\">Houston Dynamo</a>.</p>\n<p>As for the actual MLS Cup? Miami sits in 14th place of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/table/_/league/usa.1\" target=\"_blank\">MLS Eastern Conference standings</a>, and with 5 games left in the regular season, Miami must reach 9th place to have a chance to reach the playoffs. If Miami gets to 9th, it will play the 8th-place team in a wild-card match to qualify for Round 1 of MLS Cup playoffs.</p>\n<p>So far, Messi's tally is:<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Games played:</strong> 12<br>\n<strong>Goals: </strong>11<br>\n<strong>Assists: </strong>5</p>\n<p>In all, Messi could win three trophies in his debut MLS season: </p>\n<p><strong>Leagues Cup: ACHIEVED; </strong>1-1 (10-9 pens.) over Nashville SC<br>\n<strong>U.S. Open Cup: LOST; </strong>Houston Dynamo defeated Inter Miami 2-1<br>\n<strong>MLS Cup: </strong>14th place in Eastern Conference (top nine sides qualify for playoffs); next game Sept. 30 vs. New York City FC</p>\n<p>Check in here as ESPN tracks all of Messi's appearances for Inter Miami and provides instant analysis and reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>- MLS standings: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/standings/_/league/usa.1\" target=\"_blank\">Where teams are in the playoff chase</a></strong><br>\n<strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, having already won one trophy, could add another.\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sept. 27, U.S Open Cup final: Inter Miami vs. Houston Dynamo</h2>\n<p>Lionel Messi was forced to watch from the sidelines as Inter Miami lost <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/match/_/gameId/686735\" target=\"_blank\">2-1</a> to the Dynamo in the U.S. Open Cup final after he was not named in the squad due to an injury picked up while on Argentina duty and exacerbated against Toronto FC.</p>\n<p>Manager Gerardo Martino said Tuesday that whether his star player was available or not would come down to a game-time decision. When the lineup was revealed ahead of the final at DRV PNK Stadium, Messi was not listed on the team sheet.</p>\n<p>Messi's former Barcelona teammate Jordi Alba also sat out the loss as he dealt with an injury of his own and with two of its stars missing, Miami was overmatched and Houston took full advantage, scoring twice in the first half from Griffin Dorsey's close-range thunderbolt and a penalty by Amine Bassi as the visitors controlled the game.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sept. 20, MLS regular season: Inter Miami vs. Toronto FC</h2>\n<p>For the first time in a long time, Miami moved up the MLS Eastern Conference standings, jumping New York Red Bulls into 13th place -- just five points shy of 9th-placed D.C. United and a potential playoff spot.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Wednesday's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/match/_/gameId/659988\" target=\"_blank\">4-0</a> win over Toronto FC came at a huge cost, with both Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/story/_/id/38449610/lionel-messi-jordi-alba-leave-inter-miami-game-toronto\" target=\"_blank\">exiting the game in the first half due to injury</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sept. 16, MLS regular season: Atlanta United vs. Inter Miami</h2>\n<p>Saturday was the first game that Lionel Messi did not play since joining Inter Miami in July, and the team suffered its first loss in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/report/_/gameId/659979\" target=\"_blank\">5-2</a> humbling in front of a crowd of 71,635 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sept. 3, MLS regular season: LAFC vs. Inter Miami</h2>\n<p><strong>Goals: 0</strong><br>\n<strong>Assists: 2</strong></p>\n<p>For a little over 90 minutes in Los Angeles' raucous BMO Stadium, which had an eclectic group of luminaries like LeBron James, Leonardo DiCaprio and Rage Against The Machine in attendance, Messi was the brightest star in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Although the leading man wasn't able to capitalize on two opportunities on net that would have added to his tally of 11 goals in all competitions with Miami, Messi still did impressively well in a supporting role that helped carry his team to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/match/_/gameId/659966\" target=\"_blank\">3-1</a> away win.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>After an efficient first half in which Miami soaked up pressure from LAFC and opened up the scoresheet through a goal from Facundo Farias in the 14th minute, Messi would later contribute a second half assist for Jordi Alba to make it 2-0 by the 51st minute.</p>\n<p>During the final stages, Messi would step up again as a facilitator, running deep down the field with the ball before dishing it out to Leonardo Campana in the 83rd minute, thereby making it 3-0. In a high-profile game against the current MLS Cup champions where resale tickets went into the thousands, no goal would arrive for Messi on Sunday, but he performed admirably as a playmaker and distributor in the final third, which bumped up his assist tally to a total of five in all competitions.</p>\n<p>LAFC went on to score in injury time, but it proved to be a consolation goal for Ryan Hollingshead with the final whistle handing Miami three points just minutes afterwards. With the 3-1 result in hand, Miami have now extended their club-record unbeaten streak to 11 matches in all competitions. They still have a ways to go before making a run to the MLS Cup playoffs, but it's undoubtedly looking promising with Messi maintaining his blockbuster form in Hollywood.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Aug. 30, MLS regular season: Inter Miami vs. Nashville SC</h2>\n<p><strong>Goals/Assists: None</strong></p>\n<p>A rematch from the Leagues Cup final in Nashville from earlier this month, but this go-round at DRV PNK Stadium lacked the drama and fireworks. And for the first time since joining Miami, Messi did not tally a goal contribution in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/matchstats/_/gameId/659947\" target=\"_blank\">scoreless draw</a>. </p>\n<p>After coming off the bench on the road against the Red Bulls earlier this week for his MLS debut, Messi went the full 90 minutes in his first home game in league play. Miami dominated possession and had solid looks on goal, but ultimately Messi and his teammates were left frustrated by a stout Nashville defense reeling from a 4-0 defeat to Atlanta.</p>\n<p>Miami remains undefeated in the 10 games of the Messi era, but Wednesday's stalemate puts a dent in Miami's hopes of qualifying for the MLS Cup playoffs. With 10 regular season games left, Miami must still make up a lot of ground in order to get one of those nine playoff spots.  </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aug. 26, MLS debut: New York Red Bulls vs. Inter Miami</h2>\n<p><strong>Goals: 1</strong></p>\n<p>Messi needed just a few seconds for his unparalleled skills to shine: a flash of brilliance that capped a memorable Major League Soccer debut. His dazzling goal in the 89th minute helped a transformed Inter Miami beat the New York Red Bulls <a href=\"/soccer/report/_/gameId/659930\" target=\"_blank\">2-0</a> and end an 11-match league winless streak.</p>\n<p>A record crowd of 26,276 arrived at Red Bull Arena in the Red Bulls' first home sellout this season, and resale tickets were listed for over $1,000 leading to the game.</p>\n\n\n<p>Left on the bench, Messi entered the game in the 60th minute along with former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets, but chants of \"We want Messi!\" began in the sixth minute and a loud \"Mes-si!\" \"Mes-si!\" reverberated throughout in the 35th. </p>\n<p>Ahead on a 37th-minute goal by Diego Gómez, Miami made it safe late on as Busquets sent a cross to Jordi Alba just inside the penalty area and, with his back to the ground and left leg raised, Alba used the side of his foot to center the ball to Messi. The 36-year-old star settled the ball to keep it from defender Peter Stroud, dribbled to his right and threaded a pass between Andrés Reyes and Daniel Edelman to 18-year-old American Benjamin Cremaschi.</p>\n<p>As goalkeeper Carlos Coronel moved to cover his near post, Cremaschi beat defender John Tolkin and one-touched the ball back to Messi. He sprinted toward goal and let it bounce off his left foot and into the unguarded net from 3 yards for his 11th goal in nine games for Miami in all competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Aug. 23, U.S. Open Cup semifinals: Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Assists: 2</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>After that seven-game stretch and the Leagues Cup trophy lift, you would expect a hangover from Miami. Traveling to FC Cincinnati, the best team so far in the MLS regular season? On few days rest after that dramatic win in Nashville? Facing the raucous crowd at Cincy's TQL Stadium? This felt like the game where Messi's high-flying ways would finally land. </p>\n\n\n<p>But once again Miami pulled off the win on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/670651\" target=\"_blank\">penalties after a 3-3 draw</a> to clinch a spot in the final of the U.S. Open Cup, to be played Sept. 27.</p>\n<p>Messi looked fatigued all night, which was understandable after his torrid start with Miami. He lacked his trademark crispness in the midfield and rarely challenged Cincy's backline throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, down by two after goals from Luciano Acosta and Brandon Vázquez, Messi finally sprang to life when he whipped in a free kick to Lionel Campana for a header in the 68th minute. And then, with mere moments left in full-time and Miami needing a second goal, the two Leos connected again for another well-placed header. </p>\n<p>Josef Martinez scored in extra time to briefly put Miami ahead before Yuya Kubo equalized the game and sent it to penalties.</p>\n<p>And just like in the Nashville game, Miami keeper Drake Callender was clutch in goal as he thwarted Nick Hagglund's attempt -- allowing Benjamin Cremaschi to convert and sending the visitors through.</p>\n<p>For the first time since joining Miami, Messi failed to notch a goal. However, the dream of yet another trophy -- and in this case, <a href=\"https://thecup.us/us-open-cup-history/history/\" target=\"_blank\">the oldest competition in American soccer</a> -- remains alive for him. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><video2></p>\n\n\n<h2>Aug. 19, Leagues Cup final: Nashville SC vs. Inter Miami</h2>\n<p><strong>Goals: 1<br>\nTrophy: 1</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"¡Campeones! ¡Campeones! ¡Olé Olé Olé!\"</em></p>\n<p>Okay, so it may not be the Champions League or the World Cup, but Messi helping Miami beat Nashville SC on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/685799\" target=\"_blank\">penalties after a 1-1 draw</a> and lifting the Leagues Cup trophy is fairly remarkable.</p>\n<p>It gives Messi 42 senior titles, which breaks a tie with his former Barcelona teammate Dani Alves for most in men's soccer history -- and it surprised no one to see Messi win both Golden Boot (most goals with 10) and tournament MVP honors.</p>\n<p>And Messi already is the 3rd-best goal scorer in Inter Miami club history (Gonzalo Higuaín has 29 and Leo Campana has 16). </p>\n<p>In this tourney's seven-game stretch, Messi scored in every game -- including one on Saturday at Geodis Park against a tough Nashville team that had beaten some pretty potent sides (FC Cincinnati, Club America, Monterrey) on the way to hosting the final. </p>\n<p>After a feisty opening period, Messi took advantage of a momentary bit of chaos in the 23rd minute, when a wayward clearance fell to him at the top of the box. He danced around Nashville defender Walker Zimmerman with the help of a slight deflection, and he fired past Elliot Panicco in the Nashville goal.  Nashville's 57th-minute equalizer was as ugly as Messi's was sublime, as a header from Fafà Picault deflected into the net off Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender.</p>\n<p>After regulation time ended, it was time for penalties. After 11 rounds, Callender turned hero when he took he converted his attempt and saved Panicco's, giving Miami its first trophy in franchise history. </p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi led Inter Miami to winning the Leagues Cup.\"></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aug. 15, Leagues Cup semifinal: Philadelphia Union vs. Inter Miami</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Goals: 1</strong></p>\n<p>Not even a month has passed since Messi joined Miami and he already has nine goals in six games. And he now he has the team on the cusp of silverware.</p>\n<p>Inter Miami's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match?gameId=685765\" target=\"_blank\">4-1 win</a> on the road over the Philadelphia Union sealed a spot in the Leagues Cup final, as well as a berth in next year's Concacaf Champions Cup. Mind you, this is the same club that remains in last place of the MLS regular-season standings.</p>\n<p>The trip to Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, to face a defensively stout Philly team (usually) was meant to be Messi's toughest test yet, but a quick goal by Josef Martínez in the third minute put Miami in the driver's seat for the rest of evening. It was then Messi who doubled the lead in the 20th minute when he found a soft spot in the Union's midfield and fired a low bouncing shot from 30 yards out past keeper Andre Blake. </p>\n<p>With Jordi Alba's goal right before halftime, Miami was able to withstand a second-half surge from Philly that saw Alejandro Bedoya pull one back in the 73rd minute. Miami youngster David Ruiz then padded the lead with a goal in the final minutes to seal the win. </p>\n<p>And talk about a Messi effect: Miami has scored at least four goals in four of its six Leagues Cup games (including three straight). Miami entered the Leagues Cup having scored at least four goals in just three of its 122 games played across all competitions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Aug. 11, Leagues Cup quarterfinal: Inter Miami vs. Charlotte FC</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Goals: 1</strong></p>\n<p>Congrats, Charlotte! Y'all kept Messi from scoring until the final moments of the game. The bad news? Miami were already ahead by a wide margin and then comfortably won <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/685566\" target=\"_blank\">4-0</a>, booking a spot into the Leagues Cup semifinals. </p>\n<p>It took the Miami fans at DRV PNK Stadium by surprise that see Josef Martínez line up for a penalty shot in the 12th minute instead of Messi, but the Venezuelan made no question with a strike to the bottom corner of the net.</p>\n<p>And how about Robert Taylor? He has really blossomed since Messi's arrival last month. He doubled Miami's lead in the 32nd minute connecting on DeAndre Yedlin's pass at the top of the 18-yard box. The 28-year-old Finland international now has four goals and four assists (plus one own goal) in five Leagues Cup games. </p>\n<p>Charlotte defender Adilson Malanda padded Miami's lead with an own goal in the 78th minute and Miami was on cruise control before Messi <em>finally </em>got on the scoreboard, slotting the ball into the net from Leonardo Campana's nifty cross. </p>\n<p>With eight goals now, Messi once again is tied with Martínez for the team lead this season. Martínez has played 25 games to Messi's five. </p>\n<p>Miami can now look toward tough road trip to Philadelphia next week for a spot in the final.

With 10 minutes left in regulation and Miami down 4-2 after Robert Taylor's own goal, Dallas defender Marco Farfan returned the favor when he headed the ball into his own net -- off a Messi corner kick.</p>\n<p>Down by a goal with five minutes to go, it was then time for another moment for a Messi highlight reel. The Argentina superstar scored his second of the night on an incredible free kick that curled into the top corner to tie the game. </p>\n<p>Going into penalties to decide who'd advance to the Leagues Cup quarterfinal, Messi converted his attempt and Benjamin Cremaschi (who scored Miami's third in regulation) then sealed the victory with his successful strike from the spot.</p>\n<p>Messi has now scored multiple goals in three straight matches for club or country for the first time since April-May 2015, when he was still with Barcelona.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aug. 2, Leagues Cup round of 32: Inter Miami vs. Orlando City </h2>\n<p><strong>Goals: 2</strong></p>\n<p>Another brace for the captain as Miami beat Florida rivals Orlando City <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/684732\" target=\"_blank\">3-1</a> at DRV PNK Stadium and advanced to Round of 16 of the Leagues Cup tournament.</p>\n<p>A nearly two-hour long rain delay didn't throw off Messi's rhythm as he scored seven minutes in when he controlled from a pass from <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/237823/Robert-Taylor\">Robert Taylor</a> before smashing the ball past goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/150334/Pedro-Gallese\">Pedro Gallese</a> from 6 yards out.</p>\n<p>Orlando leveled the game before halftime but Miami re-took the lead after a questionable penalty was given to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/172688/josef-martinez\">Josef Martínez</a>, who then converted it from the spot and gave his team the lead again.</p>\n<p>Messi then put a stamp on the game when he again scored from close range on an assist from Martinez.</p>\n<p>The win also saw the Miami debut of defender <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/Jordi-Alba\">Jordi Alba</a>, another former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> star alongside Messi and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/Sergio-Busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a>.

With his former Barcelona teammate, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/Sergio-Busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a>, lofting a perfect ball over Atlanta's defense, Messi initially missed his first attempt but put back the rebound from his own shot past keeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/56935/Brad-Guzan\">Brad Guzan</a> to give Miami an early lead in the eighth minute.</p>\n<p>Messi then added another goal on a counterattack in the 22nd minute, pushing Atlanta's backline and laying the ball off to <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/237823/Robert-Taylor\">Robert Taylor</a>, who then cut it back with Messi calmly slotting into the net.</p>\n<p>Messi also played a key role in the other two goals -- both scored by Taylor. In Miami's fourth of the night, Messi raced down the pitch to isolate Atlanta's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/240783/ronald-hernandez\">Ronald Hernandez</a> and teed the ball to Taylor, his left flank, who connected with a low shot past a beleaguered Guzan.</p>\n<p>Along with the goals, the celebrities are rolling in for the Messi show.

Ticket prices on secondary markets, with links to sales posted on the team's social media channels as recently as Tuesday, ranged from $145 to nearly $4,000 about an hour before the match.</p>\n<p>Messi had been in and out of Miami's lineup since returning from international duty for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> with a leg injury related to an old scar tissue problem. He did not play in a loss to Atlanta United on Sept. 16 and tried to play Sept. 20 against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=7318\">Toronto FC</a> but was withdrawn after about 30 minutes in a game Miami went on to win 4-0.</p>\n<p>Alba was substituted with muscle fatigue in the Toronto game shortly before Messi, and after the match Martino said neither would play in Saturday's game away to Orlando City. Miami managed a draw in that match to keep their MLS Cup playoff hopes alive.</p>\n<p>Messi's impact on Miami since arriving in July in a blockbuster deal has been remarkable. He's scored 11 goals and contributed to a total of 16, with the team having never lost a game in which he played.</p>\n<p>Miami are five points behind <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=17606\">New York City FC</a>, which they face Saturday in MLS, in the standings for the final playoff spot with five games to play and two games in hand.</p>\n<p><em>Information from The Associated Press was used in this story.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n\n\n<p>The aura surrounding <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> arrival is such that even opposing players are awestruck in his presence. His move to Inter Miami offers them a once-in-a-lifetime chance to share the same field with a legend who has spent the better part of the past 20 years in Europe. However, the perks don't end there for a select few rivals who have secured the ultimate keepsake.</p>\n\n\n<p>For even in an era in which easy access to cameras and devices can serve to mark the moment, Messi's match-worn Inter Miami jersey remains the memento of choice, one usually earned if not because of a prior connection then through a bit of ambition in the postmatch scrum. Messi himself is aware of the power of the transaction, with his home museum in <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> already decked out from floor to ceiling as far back as six years ago.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>\"I was kind of surprised he still had his shirt on, to be honest with you,\" said <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18966\">LAFC</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/217162/john-mccarthy\">John McCarthy</a>, a recipient of Messi's jersey after Inter Miami's 3-1 win in a match between the teams on Sept. 3.</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p>In the nine postgame sessions in which he has swapped his Inter Miami jersey since arriving three months ago, Messi has picked eight Argentineans among the 12 recipients. McCarthy is one of two Americans on the list, along with Nashville's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/75577/dax-mccarty\">Dax McCarty</a>. Orlando City's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/203974/rafael-santos\">Rafael Santos</a> (<a href=\"/soccer/team?id=205\">Brazil</a>) and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a>'s <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/113752/harrison-afful\">Harrison Afful</a> (<a href=\"/soccer/team?id=4469\">Ghana</a>) round out the list.</p>\n\n\n<p>The jersey is but a little piece of Messi yet one not available to anyone else, left behind for exclusive opponents and admirers to take back home forever. ESPN spoke with some of the recipients who described what it is like to possess sports' newest holy grail.</p>\n\n\n<h3><em>¿Camiseta, por favor?</em></h3>\n\n\n<p>McCarthy, the only goalkeeper to swap shirts with Messi since his arrival, wasn't even able to offer his own jersey in return -- he had earlier given it to his Inter Miami counterpart <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/245083/drake-callender\">Drake Callender</a>. What probably impressed Messi, the former Barcelona star, was McCarthy's save on his first-half shot.</p>\n\n\n<p>After the match, McCarthy made use of what he described as his limited Spanish skills to make the jersey request as Messi drifted toward the locker room.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"All I really said was: '<i>Ah, Messi. ¿Camiseta, por favor?</i>' I felt bad because he kind of looked at me like, 'Where's yours?' in a sense,\" said McCarthy. \"I guess I'm lucky we don't have many Argentinians on the team.\"</p>\n\n\n<h3>Smells like a legend</h3>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/277208/thiago-almada\">Thiago Almada</a>, who alongside Messi was a member of <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a>'s 2022 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> champion squad, had already secured his national teammate's jersey by the time Inter Miami thrashed Atlanta United 4-0 in this summer's Leagues Cup. Almada had approached Messi in the second half as he was being subbed and made the arrangement.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"When I grabbed it, it smelled like perfume,\" Almada said in Spanish. \"On the national team, I never wanted to ask him for his jersey or bother him, so I'm very happy to have his shirt.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><inline2-wide></p>\n\n\n<h3>Plan B in effect</h3>\n\n\n<p>Sometime after that same Leagues Cup match between Miami and Atlanta, a clip of midfielder <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/271473/santiago-sosa\">Santiago Sosa</a> -- Almada's United teammate -- fruitlessly asking an already shirtless Messi to swap made the rounds, but he had already exchanged with Almada. The context of what ultimately became a viral clip capturing the moment was clear: The disappointment of losing out on a jersey is just as powerful as the joy of receiving one.</p>\n\n\n<p>Undaunted, Sosa figured out an alternate way to get his own.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"[Players] usually wear two jerseys during a game, one in the first half and another in the second,\" Sosa said. \"So I gave him mine, and he sent me one he had used [in the first half].\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The delivery was made to Atlanta's locker room, where a security guard who had been dispatched to complete the exchange quietly stood in front of Sosa and opened a nondescript bag with the pink jersey inside. Sosa confirmed the authenticity shortly, deducing it was the real deal because \"it was sweaty.\"</p>\n\n\n<h3>Keep it out of the laundry and the public</h3>\n\n\n<p>Almada and Sosa sent their keepsakes back to Argentina for storage at their respective families' homes. Each gave a set of specific instructions: Don't wash the jersey, <i>ever</i>, and keep it safe from prying eyes. However, in the age of social media, it's nearly impossible to keep something like this from becoming news.</p>\n\n\n<p>With his son's blessing, Sosa's father threw a viewing party for the jersey where he displayed the relic to a precious few guests. After a backyard grilling session, visitors were escorted to Messi's jersey and quickly snapped photos. Proximity by proxy to the man who is revered as more than a national hero in Argentina.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"A lot of people are happy for me, for having done the exchange,\" said <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=10739\">Philadelphia Union</a> midfielder and Argentinean <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/262566/julian-carranza\">Julián Carranza</a>, the recipient of Messi's jersey after Inter Miami walloped his squad 4-0 in the Leagues Cup semifinal. \"They asked me for photos of the jersey, and fortunately, I could send them.\"</p>\n\n\n<h3>Generational heirloom</h3>\n\n\n<p>It makes sense to keep Messi's jersey as safely stowed as possible. While the emotional value for each jersey is incalculable, a few have nevertheless found their way onto the market, fetching hefty fees along the way. In January, a bidder paid €43,623 -- about $46,500 -- for a game-worn jersey from Messi's time at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. In 2022, the Barcelona shirt Messi wore during the 2017 El Clásico against LaLiga archrival <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a> sold for €450,000 euros, or nearly a half million dollars.</p>\n\n\n<p>Messi's Inter Miami jerseys from his current, early MLS era probably won't experience similar fates. Instead, the lucky few jersey owners plan on keeping their prizes as heirlooms, passed down from generation to generation as a reminder of their brushes with greatness.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Having faced him is a great memory that's always going to stay with me,\" Sosa said. \"Having the shirt is something nice not just for me -- but for my family as well. It's a trophy, in a way.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Back in late 2022, Houston were more known for their flaws rather than their successes.</p>\n<p>After a drop to last in the Western Conference table in September of last year, the Dynamo fired head coach Paulo Nagamura before he was able to complete a first full season with the club. Shortly afterwards, and with slim postseason chances, they then failed to qualify for the MLS Cup playoffs for a fifth year in a row.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Needing a much-needed rebuild, Olsen, a former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=193\">D.C. United</a> coach that won the 2013 U.S. Open Cup, was then brought in as Houston coach in November of 2022. Early on in his tenure, he set out three goals: To make his players fitter, to make it clear how they should play, and to change the mentality and culture of the roster that had previous baggage.</p>\n<p>\"This is a group effort and this is hopefully just the beginning. We are far from a finished product, and in so many ways, it's a kind of restarting of the organization on the sporting side. There's a lot of movement within the front office as well,\" said Olsen, who also noted the groundwork built by general manager Pat Onstad and first-ever technical director Asher Mendelsohn. \"It's in some ways a reboot,\" Olsen added. </p>\n<p>Following a long list of reinforcements and roster changes made under Olsen and through the investment of majority owner Ted Segal, Houston began to gain steam. The defense became more reliable and rigid, team captain and Mexican international <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/146866/hector-herrera\">Héctor Herrera</a> soon began to play at the level of a league MVP candidate, and the club's home ground at Shell Energy Stadium then became a fortress with an ongoing 10W-3D-2L record in league play.</p>\n<p>Despite a busy schedule that was placed on them in 2023, Houston's heavily revamped roster benefitted from this as they made progress in not only the regular season, but also the U.S. Open Cup. \"With a lot of games you use a lot of players and that's a good thing,\" said Olsen. \"It creates a better culture. Everyone's helping the season, rather than just sitting on the sidelines.\"</p>\n<p>Physically fit, defensively solid, and eager to dish the ball through their midfield and particularly through Herrera, the team sitting at a playoff-worthy spot at fourth in MLS' Western Conference now find themselves prepping for the U.S. Open Cup final. And, prepping for their biggest challenge yet in their rebuild.</p>\n\n\n<p><video2></p>\n<h2>Aiming, or attempting, to stop Messi</h2>\n\n\n<p>\"You can lose the game, within a second,\" said Houston defender <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/218058/erik-sviatchenko\">Erik Sviatchenko</a> about defending Messi. \"He can take advantage of the slightest kind of mistake or the slightest unawareness in the team.\"</p>\n<p>Sviatchenko, a Ukrainian-born Danish player that arrived to the Dynamo earlier this year, knows plenty about the prospect of trying to impede a player like Messi. In 2016, he faced off against the Argentine twice in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/UEFA.CHAMPIONS\">UEFA Champions League</a> group stage matches between <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=256\">Celtic</a> (his former club) and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't say that I had the best experience,\" said the defender with a laugh. \"The first game we played against Messi and Barcelona, with Celtic, we lost 7-0.\" The second game, in which he earned a yellow card for fouling the Argentine forward, was lost 2-0. With that experience in hand, he's taken internal lessons.</p>\n<p>\"We need to be very compact and we really need to be ready,\" stated Sviatchenko about how to deal with Messi on Wednesday. \"If someone loses their marker or loses a duel, then the next guy will be there, to help each other. It's a mindset more than it is a way of defending.\"</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Houston Dynamo defender Erik Sviatchenko has faced Messi twice before when the Argentine played for Barcelona and Sviatchenko played for Celtic.\"></p>\n<p>Remaining compact and organized will be key for Houston as they attempt to stop Messi and others from creating dangerous chances, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee that they'll simply sit back and let others dictate the game.</p>\n<p>\"One important thing for us is to keep the ball and to be clean on the ball,\" added <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/236342/artur\">Artur</a>, a midfielder and fellow new addition to the 2023 season for Houston. \"Because for me, it's the best way to defend, it's when you don't need to defend. So we need to keep the ball well, to move the ball and maybe make them defend a little bit.\"</p>\n<p>Another option is to shut down Messi higher up the field. Considering that the Dynamo are averaging 12.8 fouls and 2.56 yellow cards per MLS game, this may not be out of the question.</p>\n<p>\"If you can keep him away from goal for as long as the game goes on, because Messi sometimes in the role he has now, he also drifts away from goal to get the ball,\" said Sviatchenko when asked about a potential source of weakness for the Miami player. \"But of course it won't be possible for 90 minutes. He will pop up, he will pop up in spaces where he'll get himself in dangerous spots, either to assist or to have a hit on goal. It's very difficult to see where the weaknesses are,\" added Sviatchenko. </p>\n<p>Olsen, in his own way, also reaffirmed the idea that Messi will be a highly unique complication to face. \"Let me ask the 5,000 coaches that have tried before to stop him that have not been able to, guys with better credentials than me,\" remarked Olsen.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n<h2>The right 'mentality' but pressure on Miami</h2>\n\n\n<p>What will make things especially difficult for Houston is that Messi won't be alone. While it's easy to focus on other elite figures such as Busquets and Alba, Miami have been able to get additional attacking impact from names like <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/284834/leonardo-campana\">Leonardo Campana</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/237823/robert-taylor\">Robert Taylor</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/298592/facundo-farias\">Facundo Farías</a>, among a handful of others.</p>\n<p>\"Of course you want to condense space and limit him [Messi] and do all the things that everybody tries to do with all great No. 10s, but really we'll dissect them as a group and we'll do what we do with all teams,\" said Olsen about preparation. \"What we need to focus on, where we need to maybe tweak some of our tactics, [is] to prevent their strengths and also figure out how to exploit their weaknesses. That's all we're doing for each team and there won't be any different preparation.\"</p>\n<p>Sviatchenko agreed with this concept of seeing it as a more of a task against a group and not an individual. \"I think we just need to take it as a great opportunity as a team, as a player, to face not only a player [like Messi], but a team that has great individuals in [it], and it's a good team,\" said the Houston defender.</p>\n<p>The idea of a necessary level-headed state of mind in a high-profile game like Wednesday's was also brought up by Sviatchenko.</p>\n<p>\"The mentality is something that is the most important when you go into these decisive games that are finals. We have a group that has been in finals, that have won finals. I think we need to take on that kind of experience and to share that experience,\" said the former Celtic player.</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes it's difficult to share it verbally, but it's more easy to share when you're out in the field...to be concentrated, to be focused on every single detail of the game and it's only 90 minutes, you know, and we are able to concentrate ourselves for 90 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>Olsen, metaphorical cards held close to his chest, did eventually give in a little when the topic of the team's messaging and mentality was brought up. He wasn't willing to share any details and reinforced that he didn't \"really want to get into that,\" but he did briefly shed some light on the awareness on how others see Houston and Miami as they head into the final.</p>\n<p>\"Certainly, the pressure will be on them [Miami]. They're at home, they'll be the favorites,\" said Olsen. \"We're used to that, we kind of live in that space anyway, so nothing will change as far as where the expectations are from outside Houston and our locker room.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're fine with that,\" said Olsen. </p>\n\n\n\n\n",

And I say this on behalf of all of us, because we want to see Leo on the pitch for a long time.

While it's a possibility he might still <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38420249/sources-possibility-aaron-rodgers-returns-year\">return this season</a>, this wasn't what the Jets had in mind when they traded for him in the offseason.</p>\n\n\n<p>Miraculously, the team pulled out a win in Week 1, but a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547415\">30-10 drubbing</a> at the hands of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a> in Week 2 reminded everyone just how much they'll miss a healthy Rodgers this season.</p>\n\n\n<p>It is, of course, not the first time a player's heralded debut with a new team fell flat. The best-laid plans of mice and general managers often go awry, and many fans have been left scratching their heads after a ballyhooed acquisition dropped the ball in Game 1. With Rodgers on the mend, here are some others that came to mind.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a></h2>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>James' second stint with his hometown team in 2014-15 started inauspiciously. Playing against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> in Cleveland, James managed a paltry 17 points on 5-of-15 shooting (making only one of his five three-pointers) to go along with five rebounds, four assists and eight turnovers. LeBron would quickly turn things around, however, leading the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals that season and winning them the next.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Troy Aikman, Dallas Cowboys</h2>\n<p>Considering how Aikman ended up as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, it's surprising to recall that his rookie season was a bit of a disaster. Aikman started off 1989 going 17-for-35 with 180 yards passing and two interceptions in a shutout loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints\">New Orleans Saints</a>. It didn't get much better from there. He finished the season with nine touchdowns to 18 interceptions and an 0-11 W-L record. The Cowboys didn't lose faith, however, and Aikman won his first of three Super Bowls just three seasons later.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064514/julius-randle\">Julius Randle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a></h2>\n<p>The seventh pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Randle looked to be a good candidate to learn from Kobe Bryant at the back end of his legendary career. Randle's 2014-15 season lasted all of 14 minutes, however, as he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/11783195/julius-randle-los-angeles-lakers-suffers-serious-right-leg-injury-opener\">broke his tibia</a> in his debut and missed the rest of the season. After a few years with the Lakers and a single season with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a>, Randle has found a home as one of the pillars of the modern New York Knicks.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3989/blake-griffin\">Blake Griffin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a></h2>\n<p>Griffin had the bad fortune to get injured immediately <i>before</i> his debut. After landing on a dunk in his final preseason game in 2009, Griffin <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4597949\">broke his kneecap</a>, sidelining him for the entirety of what would have been his rookie season. Things went much better in 2010-11, with a fully recovered Griffin making the All-Star team and winning Rookie of the Year.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/202/argentina\">Argentina</a></h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>Already a legend in the making, having led Argentina's youth team to a title and winning the tournament's Golden Ball in the process, Messi's first friendly with the senior team could have gone better. He was given a red card less than a minute after coming on later in the second half for elbowing Hungarian defender Vilmos Vanczak and reportedly was crying in the locker room afterward. Considering his incredible accomplishments since then, it's an almost unimaginable scene.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a></h2>\n<p>The first pick of the 2009 NFL draft, Stafford carried the hopes of Lions fans in his talented hands. Those hopes were (at least briefly) dashed in his first game, a 45-27 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Stafford went 16-for-36 for 205 yards passing with no touchdowns and three interceptions. Injuries would limit him for the remainder of the 2009 season and most of 2010, but he was fully operational in 2011, throwing for 5,038 yards and 41 touchdowns against 16 interceptions.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Chris Bosh, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a></h2>\n<p>The often-underappreciated but crucial third member of the Miami Heat's Big Three alongside James and Dwyane Wade, Bosh was ice cold in his 2010 debut with the team. He shot 3-for-11 from the field, pulled down eight rebounds and was minus-17 in an 88-80 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics\">Boston Celtics</a>. Fortunately for all involved, the Heat would end up pretty happy with Bosh and the Big Three, as they ended up winning back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n",

  "<p><photo caption=\"Inter Miami are undefeated in MLS play since signing Lionel Messi, but do they have enough to make an unlikely playoff appearance?\"></p>\n<p>The playoff push in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> is on! Well, sort of.</p>\n<p>Some teams have just six matches left in the regular season, while others have as many as eight games remaining.</p>\n<p>MLS announced a new playoff format this season: the top nine teams from each conference qualify, although there are big incentives to finish in the top seven and miss the wild-card round or, even better, in the top four to host two games in the newly designed round one, which will be played as a best-of-three series. The conference semifinals, conference finals and MLS Cup are all one-off games hosted by the higher seed.</p>\n<p>While the format has changed, it's relatively easy to look back at past seasons and settle on a points target of 43 to have a reasonable expectation to get into the ninth and final spot. The final number could be one point or so higher or lower, but for now, most people around the league agree that's a reasonable target.</p>\n<p>So, where is everyone at as the season comes to a close? Here's a look at teams with hopes of a postseason run, broken into tiers, starting with one of the most important distinctions:</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<h2>Teams with Messi</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>'s arrival to <strong><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami</a> </strong>(28 points), and the additions of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a> and even lesser-known names like <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/358595/tomas-aviles\">Tomás Avilés</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/298592/facundo-farias\">Facundo Farías</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/192278/diego-gomez\">Diego Gómez</a> has changed what seemed possible for an MLS team.</p>\n<p>After winning Leagues Cup, Inter Miami still found themselves sitting in the basement of MLS's Eastern Conference, needing a miracle run to have any hope of making the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Miracles happen with Messi.</p>\n<p>While Inter currently sit in 14th with 28 points, six back from <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=193\">D.C. United</a> (34 points) in the ninth and final postseason position, an undefeated run in the four matches since MLS play resumed makes it feel foolish to bet against Messi & Co.</p>\n<p>One of the issues for Miami is that they'll also have to do it without Messi. They passed their first test without their talisman, though, coming from behind to beat <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=186\">Sporting Kansas City</a> 3-2 on Saturday.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Five wins and a draw from their final eight games could be enough to do it, and with matches against direct rivals <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=17606\">New York City FC</a> (30 points), the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=182\">Chicago Fire</a> (32 points) and a pair of contests against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a> (31 points), there's a possible path to the postseason -- even if Inter will need help from other Eastern Conference rivals along the way.</p>\n<p>Yet a road trip to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18418\">Atlanta United</a> (42 points) on Sept. 16 and a game at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=12011\">Orlando City SC</a> (47 points) on Sept. 24 loom as reminders it won't always be easy. Plus, while a scoreless home draw against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18986\">Nashville SC</a> (40 points) on Aug. 30 hardly put the nail in the coffin for Miami's playoff hopes, it was a reminder of just how small the margin for error is for this team, with any dropped points at home making it that much more difficult to sneak into the playoffs and regroup once there.</p>\n<p>They should be toast, <a href=\"http://playoffstatus.com/mls/easternstandings.html\" target=\"_blank\">playoffstatus.com</a> says they have an 87% chance of missing the playoffs, but the numbers aren't factoring in the extra boost Messi and his running buddies have given the Herons.</p>\n<h2>If not Miami, who?</h2>\n<p>Atlanta United are by no means home free with a top-nine berth but have 42 points and six games left, the first one at home against Inter Miami after the international break. Right below them in the East comes Nashville.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Then things get interesting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/9720/cf-montreal\">CF Montreal</a> have 35 points, seven more than Miami and just three more than the Chicago Fire, who sit in 10th, one place out of the playoff positions. D.C. United cling to the ninth and final spot with 34 points. Montreal, one of the league's worst road teams with 10 away defeats, play four of their last seven contests at home and will need to accumulate as many points as possible in Quebec to clinch a place.</p>\n<p>While Chicago sit just below the line, the Fire are on a four-game losing skid they'll hope to end with a trip to Montreal on Sept. 16. It's a game that looks crucial for both teams' hopes.</p>\n<p>Charlotte are behind Chicago in the table but have one fewer match played. Closing the season with a road trip to Miami, then hosting the Herons, means they should control their own destiny but first need to prove they're worthy of the playoff place with a September stretch that sees them play three of the East's top four teams.</p>\n<p>The New York teams haven't been able to wrest attention away from Messi, both registering 1.07 points per match this season. The numbers say it's much more likely NYCFC and the Red Bulls will miss out on the playoffs than make it, and the first game back from the international break, a Hudson River Derby at Yankee Stadium has the feel of a must-win.</p>\n<h2>Teams in or almost there</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> (57 points) already have the beautiful \"X\" by their name in the standings, signifying they've clinched a postseason place, and know they will play on. The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=189\">New England Revolution</a> and Western Conference-leading <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/21812/st-louis-city-sc\">St. Louis City</a> on 48 points, Orlando City on 47 and the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=10739\">Philadelphia Union</a> on 46 also are feeling very little heat. The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=183\">Columbus Crew</a>, too, have all but clinched qualification, already surpassing our 43-point target (45 points) with seven games to play.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<h2>Should be good, but ...</h2>\n<p>Just behind St. Louis City in the West, the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=9726\">Seattle Sounders</a> (41 points) and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18966\">LAFC</a> (40 points) are a win away from our 43-point standard. LAFC still have seven games to go and will feel they can mount a charge for a top seed.</p>\n<p>Seattle have fewer games left but also are well situated to earn not just playoff games but to get a home-field edge. Past seasons indicate an average of 53 points has been enough to score the No. 4 spot, so the Sounders will look to slightly beat their current PPG to finish in the top four.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=4771\">Real Salt Lake</a> (40 points) and the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=6077\">Houston Dynamo</a> (39 points) have slightly worse points-per-game numbers but also are far more likely to play past Decision Day than to see the season end after match 34.</p>\n<p>The math says even the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=9727\">Vancouver Whitecaps</a>, on 38 points, and five points above 10th-place <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20906\">Austin FC</a> (33 points), should feel comfortable about their current standing. For one, Vancouver still have eight games left, meaning they could draw the rest of their contests and hit the 43-point target. The remaining schedule looks a bit daunting, with the team currently on a long road trip while Beyonce calls BC Place home, but getting another 10 points or so should be manageable considering some of those trips are to teams no longer contending and they end with three of four at home.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<h2>The mess in the West</h2>\n<p>Things get interesting around spot seven in the West, where <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=17362\">Minnesota United</a> are in seventh with 37 points. The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=191\">San Jose Earthquakes</a> have the same point total in eighth and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> hold the final playoff spot with 34 points.</p>\n<p>The home-road splits may decide the final three playoff spots in the West. Minnesota, strangely, have managed just three home wins but are by far the best of the bunch away from home. The Loons have one game more remaining than San Jose, while Dallas have two games in hand.</p>\n<p>Below the teams currently occupying the playoff places, Austin lead the charge, one point back from FCD with one more game played.</p>\n<p>And while it might be tempting to forget about the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=9723\">Portland Timbers</a>, in 11th with 33 points, Sporting KC in 12th on 32 and the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=187\">LA Galaxy</a> in 13th with 30, they're still on the playoff radar. The Timbers recently changed managers and have seen a minibounce, with two wins and a draw ahead of the final six games, and the Galaxy the joint-most matches left to play with eight.</p>\n<h2>No Messi? No miracle</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=7318\">Toronto FC</a> (22 points) have some big-name players with European experience, but it hasn't worked out like Messi, Busquets and Alba showing up did for Miami. They're not going to be able to put together a push, sitting 12 back from the line in the East and yet to win a single match away from home this season.</p>\n<p>Neither will the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=184\">Colorado Rapids</a>, who just fired coach Robin Fraser and with 19 points (just 0.73 a game) would have to make up an 11-point gap to even catch the team currently one slot above them in 13th place.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a> coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino said Friday he doesn't think <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> sustained any kind of serious injury in <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a>'s opening <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> qualifying win over <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=209\">Ecuador</a> on Thursday, but that he should know more soon regarding his star's status.</p>\n<p>Messi scored on a trademark free kick before leaving with a minute remaining in<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/684579\" target=\"_blank\"> the 1-0 victory.</a></p>\n<p>\"It does not seem like anything important,\" said Martino. \"Some symptoms of fatigue, at least that's the information we have. We will know more today.\"</p>\n<p>When asked after the game about Messi's atypical departure before the final whistle, Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said Messi asked to be substituted because \"felt something,\" while Messi himself said he was just \"a little bit tired.\"</p>\n<p>Argentina will face the daunting trip to high-altitude <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/124121/bolivia\">Bolívia</a> on Tuesday before Messi is scheduled to be back in South Florida following the international break, along with many other teammates who will all miss Saturday's home <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> game against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=186\">Sporting Kansas City</a> while on duty with their countries.</p>\n<p>When asked about the possibility of Messi not traveling to La Paz and returning to Inter Miami instead, Martino said he doubted that would happen.</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't venture to say as of now,\" said Martino. \"It is early. Today could be an important day [regarding that decision], but I don't imagine so if he has a chance to play against Bolivia.\"</p>\n<p>Martino said Friday he has been ready for weeks for this game with a short-handed group and is hoping some lesser-used individuals step up.</p>\n<p>\"We know that on all squads this happens,\" said Martino. \"There are players that play a lot more, others that play less that have to take advantage of these types of occasions.</p>\n<p>\"But it's also not true that the game depends exclusively on these players who are going to play more now. They need to make the best effort along with the rest. We've known about these absences since the new players arrived, so for the past 20 days we imagined we would be in this spot, so this is no surprise.\"</p>\n<p>One pleasant surprise did come earlier this week when it was revealed that Martino will have red-hot goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/245083/drake-callender\">Drake Callender</a> at his disposal for the match, as the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=660\">United States</a> men's national team has allowed Callender to stay in South Florida and miss the team's friendly the same day against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=2570\">Uzbekistan</a> in St. Louis.</p>\n<p>He is expected to rejoin the USMNT before Tuesday's game against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=2841\">Oman</a> in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>And while Martino will certainly be missing many key contributors on Saturday, he is expected to have several frequent starters available for selection (along with Callender) in the form of Messi's former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> teammates <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a>, center back <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/249756/kamal-miller\">Kamal Miller</a>, full back <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/183778/deandre-yedlin\">DeAndre Yedlin</a> and striker <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/284834/leonardo-campana\">Leonardo Campana</a>.</p>\n<p>Recent young Argentine arrivals <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/298592/facundo-farias\">Facundo Farías</a> -- who scored in Sunday's 3-1 road win against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18966\">LAFC</a> -- and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/358595/tomas-aviles\">Tomás Avilés</a>, will also likely be in the starting 11.</p>\n<p>\"We have a very good team available to play Kansas City,\" said Martino. \"We have the same hope of every game, with the expectation to be able to remain on this track and shorten the distance between us and the playoffs.\"</p>\n<p>Inter Miami currently sits in 14th place in the MLS Eastern Conference, five spots and eight points off the final MLS Cup Playoff position, which is occupied for now by DC United.</p>\n<p>A win over Sporting KC on Saturday could move them to within one point of the 13th-placed <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=190\">New York Red Bulls</a>, who will not be in action this weekend and have lost three straight games, including a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Miami late last month.</p>\n<p>Miami's following game will be at Atlanta United on Saturday, Sept. 16, and it may be difficult to see Messi starting that game only two or three days after arriving back in South Florida.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/207921/hernan-galindez\">Hernán Galíndez</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=209\">Ecuador</a>'s goalkeeper, was born in the Argentine city of Rosario in 1987 and likes to tell the story of the first goal he ever conceded in youth football after he switched from being a striker. It was scored by a local contemporary of his by the name of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>.</p>\n<p>Messi may have helped himself to the first goal past Galindez, but the 36-year-old now has the last -- an exquisite 77th-minute free kick which gave <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> a 1-0 win at home to Ecuador in the first round of 2026 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> qualifiers.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong><br>\n<strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.worldq.conmebol\" target=\"_blank\">Visit ESPN's South American WCQ homepage</a></strong></p>\n<p>Up until that point, Galindez and Ecuador could feel happy about their evening's work. Galindez had just dived left to block a Messi shot, the product of a typically elusive dribble after an exchange with <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/174466/rodrigo-de-paul\">Rodrigo De Paul</a>. Otherwise, though, the goalkeeper had been seldom troubled as Ecuador stuck to their gameplan on a cold night in Buenos Aires.</p>\n<p>Ecuador coach Felix Sanchez set up his team with a back three and packed the midfield. Against physically imposing opponents it was hard for Argentina to work their way through and, with pace and talent on the break, Ecuador would provide occasional reminders that they had an attacking threat of their own.</p>\n<p>There were times when Argentina made the ball fizz and De Paul enjoyed the space he found with Ecuador pre-occupied by Messi. A glorious four-man move brought memories of the successful 2022 World Cup campaign when <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/249299/alexis-mac-allister\">Alexis Mac Allister</a> pulled the ball back for Messi to shoot just wide from the edge of the area. De Paul then crossed for <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/219713/lautaro-martinez\">Lautaro Martínez</a> to stretch out a boot and turn the ball onto the far post.</p>\n<p>Martinez had been surprisingly preferred to Julian Avarez up front, presumably to do battle with the Ecuador's tall centre-backs. And with the aim of stretching out the pitch, Nico Gonzalez started on the left wing ahead of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/108223/angel-di-maria\">Ángel Di María</a>. But hard as they tried, Argentina could not force their way through.</p>\n<p>Defender <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/96970/cristian-romero\">Cristian Romero</a> came up from the back to make an auxiliary striker, reaching the right byline and pulling a ball across for Nico Tagliafico's shot to clip the bar on its way over. It is an indication of the perils of overcommitting players forward that Romero's next vital action was inside his own penalty area, as he was forced to make a saving tackle when <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/171771/enner-valencia\">Enner Valencia</a> was bearing down on goal.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi broke the deadlock with a free kick to hand Argentina the win.\"></p>\n<p>Di Maria came on, Alvarez was introduced, but in the end it was all about Messi. An attacking melee -- in which Romero was once more involved -- brought a free kick on the edge of the area. Messi dinked it over the wall as easily as if he had picked the ball up with his hands and placed it in the far corner. Galindez had no chance.</p>\n<p>So the story goes on, which leads to the question: how long can Messi go on? How long does he want to go on? The No. 10 had seemed to dismiss talk of still being around for the 2026 World Cup, when he will be approaching 40, but the nearer the competition comes the greater the pressure to give it a try.</p>\n<p>The Argentina team built by Lionel Scaloni in these extraordinary five years has very much been Messi surrounded by his fan club. If 2026 really is a bridge too far for Argentina's captain, then Scaloni may have got himself in a position where his side can no longer play with Messi but cannot play without him either.</p>\n\n\n\n",

Messi-mania has swept America, but my strain of it wasn't really about Messi at all.</p>\n<p>I looked at Miami's schedule and put a pin in its away game against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18966\">LAFC</a> on Sept. 3, maybe so that I could pretend we'd be saying goodbye only to summer. I scored two seats in the front row of the North Stand, at the bottom of the 3252, LAFC's army of ultras. \"How?\" Sammy asked when I told him we were going. It was too hard to explain that a father fighting to keep his grip on his son is a formidable opponent to reason.</p>\n<p>We spent a couple of fantastic days together in L.A., and then Sunday came. That morning, Sammy and I spent hours getting thrashed by the surf in Santa Monica.</p>\n<p>Now we found ourselves at the bottom of a different kind of surge in the shadow of downtown.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Sammy Jones looks on from the supporters' section during LAFC's 3-1 defeat to Lionel Messi's Inter Miami.\"></p>\n<p>\"When we score,\" a kid dressed in black behind us said, \"cover your heads.\"</p>\n<p>Messi took the field, a little duck-footed man dressed in pink, and I leaned into Sammy and pointed at him the way I'd dreamed I might. Sammy did me a great favor and nodded as though he didn't already know what I wanted to teach him.</p>\n<p>Then the whistle blew. Outwardly, at least, the 3252 was unmoved by the presence of the greatest football player the world has ever seen. The group beat its drums and waved its flags and sang its songs and threw its insults unabated.</p>\n<p>The rest of the supposedly home crowd didn't bother hiding their love and wonder, rising and falling with Messi's every move the way the tides follow the fancies of the moon.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>The casuals and celebrities in attendance -- Prince Harry! Leonardo DiCaprio! Selena Gomez! -- were almost hilariously single-minded in their viewing, never mind the adjacent near-greatness of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a>. It was like watching tourists at the Louvre flock toward the Mona Lisa, ignorant to The Raft of the Medusa and Liberty Leading the People waiting just over there.</p>\n<p>Regarding Messi in the flesh for the first time is disquieting in its way, even absent the strange attention vacuum he creates. Initiates expect an unbroken string of brilliance.</p>\n<p>Instead, he can look lost for long stretches of the game, wandering around like a man in a food court who's not quite sure what he wants for lunch. Then he sees the play break through his singular lens, and suddenly he's at the top of the box, poised to make something out of nothing.</p>\n<p>Messi missed a couple of early chances, giving LAFC goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/217162/john-mccarthy\">John McCarthy</a> a story to tell his grandchildren one day. (McCarthy later got Messi's shirt as proof.)</p>\n<p>He never did score. He still did Messi things.</p>\n<p>\"How did he know that guy was there?\" Sammy asked me after one sublime switch, and I can't tell you how happy that made me. My teenage son was leaning into me again, excited, chatty, engaged. When he took out his phone, it was only to take pictures. He was lit up like a kid.</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p>I watched the clock and willed it to slow down. Halftime came in what felt like seconds. By then, Messi had already celebrated an Inter Miami goal in front of our eyes.</p>\n<p>Later, he assisted two more. The first delivery, to an invisible Alba, felt like the sort of moment that demanded a plaque immediately be set in the grass.</p>\n<p>\"Messi! Messi! Messi!\" the crowd chanted.</p>\n<p>LAFC snatched one back at the death. It had taken so long, Sammy and I forgot to cover our heads. We turned to watch the 3252 erupt. A foamy cascade of beer poured down on us, enough for a smiling Sammy to catch a mouthful.</p>\n<p>\"Your first beer!\" I laughed.</p>\n<p>\"No, pops,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"While the neutrals were there to see Lionel Messi, the 3252 was relentless in its support of LAFC.\"></p>\n<p>That is how things will go between us from now on. That is a fact.</p>\n<p>But it is also a fact that one Sunday in September, way back in 2023, Sammy and I swam in the ocean and then watched Lionel Messi play. Whatever else happens between us, however our orbits change and diverge, those things will have happened, too. If we share nothing else, we will share those memories, and we will share them forever.</p>\n<p>The final whistle blew.</p>\n<p>\"You enjoy that?\" I asked Sammy. He nodded and gave me a hug. \"Good,\" I said. \"Me, too.\"</p>\n<p>We watched the players walk off the field. The rest of the stadium emptied. My son and I stood together and looked out at the grass, under the last of the lights, at the end of a blessed night in Los Angeles. Finally, I moved to go.</p>\n<p>\"Can we stay a little longer?\" Sammy asked.</p>\n<p>I looked at my boy and marveled.</p>\n<p>Suddenly there he was, all grown up. There he was, the one who didn't want to leave.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> international's shock arrival in North America sparked <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a> on the field -- the last-place club ran through Leagues Cup, defeating Nashville 10-9 on penalties, and won their first MLS match of the second half of the season -- and fans off it.</p>\n<p>In Dallas, in Philly, in Cincinnati, in New York, in Los Angeles this weekend, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38010627/messi-publix-inter-miami\">in Publix</a> (!), the Messi Show is loud, boisterous, and celebratory, even when the boobirds arrive.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>\"That wasn't necessarily planned so much as it was every game has a villain,\" Mueller said. \"Sometimes it's a center-back who commits a bad foul or a goalkeeper who starts time wasting in the first half. For that game, it just happened to be him.\"</p>\n<p>In Philadelphia, they called it the Messi Circus.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"The word 'carnival' is thrown around a lot, but it's true,\" Sons of Ben game day coordinator Robert Migliaccio said of the atmosphere at the Leagues Cup semifinal on Aug. 16. \"You had vendors out the wazoo on all the streets selling different things. Yes, they're selling the Messi jerseys, but they're also selling food and drinks, and anybody that could cash in on the Messi effect did.\"</p>\n<p>Local news channels, often slow to cover the Union until they make a deep playoff run, set up live shots outside Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>Even with the Union going down early, \"the stadium was still electric and loud throughout,\" Migliaccio said. \"My capos and drummers probably had one of the best games of their lives.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAthleticSCCR/status/1691580725529600491\" target=\"_blank\">The Union faithful booed Messi</a> as well, but, you know, Philly fans will boo anyone anytime. It's part of their charm.</p>\n<p>At Red Bull Arena, nearly 27,000 fans shouted, \"We want Messi,\" breaking into cheers when he came on in the 60th minute in a match that <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=190\">New York Red Bulls</a> general manager Marc De Grandpre said would be the largest-grossing revenue gate for an MLS fixture in club history. (We'll get to ticket prices in a bit ...)</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>It's been a remarkable debut month and a half for Messi & Co: six wins, three draws, plus-16 goal differential, dozens of highlights, one trophy, another final to play in the U.S. Open Cup, scintillating football, far from a retirement league.</p>\n<p>\"The part of it that's most appreciated from my perspective is that he tries and he cares,\" Mueller said. \"He's here. He's hustling. He's scoring and putting players in positions to score.\"</p>\n<p>Which isn't to say there haven't been issues.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"\"></p>\n<p>The ticket market is, uh, out of control, with prices on the secondary market for Sunday's match at <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18966\">LAFC</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kyle_Zorn/status/1696245349994639613\" target=\"_blank\">approaching what it would cost to attend every Los Angeles Rams or LA Chargers home game</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElMatadorFCD/status/1687616924656574466\" target=\"_blank\">The Leagues Cup organizing committee priced out Murga 117</a>, an <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> supporter band, due to the exorbitant cost to get into Toyota Stadium, while other Leagues Cup tickets were extreme as well.</p>\n<p>\"The fact that the supporter section seat -- the $20 ticket -- was initially $300, and then when the full public presale started, it was around $700, is a ludicrous jump in price,\" Mueller said of the final in Nashville.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=182\">Chicago Fire</a> moved their match against Inter Miami to Solider Field, pumped the ticket prices and will gross more revenue for a single game than for all others on their scheduled combined, according to <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4733727/2023/07/31/messi-money-mls-miami/\" target=\"_blank\">The Athletic</a>. On one hand, it's hard to say no to that influx of cash. On the other, the cash grab is pretty gross and antithetical to MLS' ethos of consistent, slow and organic growth.</p>\n<p>And there's a second drawback, which is that Messi is 36 years old and needs to rest at some point. An injured Messi does no one any good. He didn't start against the Red Bulls and manager Tata Martino said he'll sit at least three times during the remainder of the season. Imagine paying hundreds of dollars for a ticket to see your hometown team host Inter Miami, only for a certain Argentine star to ride the bench.</p>\n<p>So yes, his arrival has been messy at times, but really, the Messi Circus couldn't have been expected to go much better. He has breathed new life into away stadiums and broadcasts alike. He has, most importantly, been fun as hell to watch, in person and on television. For a league that wants to grow and needs to grow, he's been nitrogen-enriched fertilizer, giving diehard supporters someone to cheer for and route against, and bringing new fans to the sport.</p>\n<p>\"Even though we lost, I still think it was a major win for the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=10739\">Philadelphia Union</a> and their fans because we were there to provide entertainment for the night and potentially provide an experience for a kid at his first game,\" Migliaccio said. \"I kept walking around that stadium, seeing the families there, and thinking, 'I hope they remember this as much as much as I do.'</p>\n<p>\"And who knows? Maybe one day that kid plays for the Union, then goes over to Europe, and becomes the next Messi. And you know why? Because of that one night down in Chester.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a> coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino said Tuesday that <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a> will likely return to the starting lineup for Wednesday's home matchup against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18986\">Nashville SC</a>.</p>\n<p>The former <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> stars both came off the bench at the hour mark in Saturday's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/659930\" target=\"_blank\">2-0 road win</a> against the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=190\">New York Red Bulls</a>, with Messi scoring in his first <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> game.

Miami's MLS games either side of those are on Sept. 3 and Sept. 16.</p>\n<p>There is also another international break Oct. 10-17, which means Messi could potentially miss Inter Miami's game with <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a>. That contest was originally scheduled for Aug. 20, but the team announced Monday it will now take place on Oct. 18.</p>\n<p>In addition to Messi, Martino could also be missing up to 11 other players for the Sporting KC game, including several consistent starters along the back line in the form of <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/183778/deandre-yedlin\">DeAndre Yedlin</a> (<a href=\"/soccer/team?id=660\">United States</a>), <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/249756/kamal-miller\">Kamal Miller</a> (<a href=\"/soccer/team?id=206\">Canada</a>) and Serhiy Kryvtsov (<a href=\"/soccer/team?id=457\">Ukraine</a>).

  "<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami</a> manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino said Friday that Lionel Messi's availability for his potential <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> debut this weekend remains up in the air.</p>\n<p>Inter Miami is in New York preparing for Saturday's contest against the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=190\">New York Red Bulls</a>, the team's seventh game in just 23 days.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<p>\"We will assess further after this evening's training,\" Martino said. \"It is inevitable that we will not have him at some point.\"</p>\n<p>The 36-year-old Messi has played every minute of Miami's past six games and looked exhausted at times in Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup semifinal win at <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a>, which went the maximum 120 minutes. Messi claimed two assists and converted the opening kick in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/670651\">penalty shootout victory</a>.</p>\n<p>The team flew straight to New York from Ohio, and had a recovery session at the hotel after arriving Thursday. It was set to have a light practice Friday at Red Bull Arena.</p>\n<p>\"This will happen at least three times this year, and next year more,\" Martino said regarding the potential resting of Messi, either for an entire game or part of one. \"We will have to find a solution.\"</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>That solution won't be easy to come by, as the veteran manager has relied heavily on Messi since his arrival. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> winner has exceeded all expectations with 10 goals and three assists in eight appearances.</p>\n<p>And with Miami at the bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference -- 14 points adrift of the final playoff spot -- Martino surely knows he'll need to use Messi as much as possible the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>The former <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/203/mexico\">Mexico</a> national team and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> coach insisted Friday he won't be distracted by the outside noise regarding the implications of benching his superstar.</p>\n<p>Messi-mania has resulted in the cheapest tickets for Saturday's game at the 25,000-capacity Red Bull Arena across the Hudson River in Harrison, New Jersey, currently going for over $400 on secondary resale sites. What's more, hundreds of fans were camped out Friday afternoon outside the team hotel, hoping to see a glimpse of their soccer hero.</p>\n<p>\"I understand the expectations the rest of the world has to watch him, and that is undeniable,\" Martino said. \"But I cannot act based on that, because then I would risk doing things wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Doing things wrong in this case would mean pushing Messi too much and risking injury to the star player, something that could derail any chance of a postseason run.</p>\n<p>One thing helping Martino's cause is that his team is a lot deeper in the midfield heading into this game than it has been in previous weeks.</p>\n<p>Veteran <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/198531/jean-mota\">Jean Mota</a> is back healthy after the Brazilian missed nearly four months of action following a knee injury, and new young South American talents <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/192278/diego-gomez\">Diego Gómez</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/298592/facundo-farias\">Facundo Farías</a> are more integrated into the squad thanks to a good spell of training sprinkled in-between all of these games.</p>\n<p>However, things won't get any easier after this weekend.

This time, it was <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> as the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> superstar and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a> earned a ticket to the U.S. Open Cup final -- the oldest ongoing soccer competition in the country. This was days after lifting the Leagues Cup, the club's first-ever trophy.</p>\n<p>Wednesday's game carried the same echoes we have heard ever since he played his first game for Miami on July 21 against <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/218/cruz-azul\">Cruz Azul</a>. \"Messi, Messi, Messi,\" chanted by both Miami and Cincy fans. Kids, adults, even the elderly (I personally witnessed three Ohio grandmothers inside the grounds at TQL Stadium) wearing his Argentina shirt.</p>\n<p>Eight matches in 32 days. From Dallas to Philly, Cincy and back to South Florida, the national sentiment seems to align with something I feel extremely strongly about: Messi is the biggest arrival in American sports history, and when it's all said and done, he will have been (along with Michael Jordan) the biggest star to have ever played here.</p>\n<p>Because of his global recognition, by the time the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">World Cup</a> comes to this country in 2026, I daresay he could even surpass Jordan. No, I am not comparing these athletes or conjuring a rivalry; I am simply saying the spectacle of Messi is <em>that</em> gargantuan.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>And he hasn't even played an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> game yet.</p>\n<p>Now, people will scoff at this. They will angrily comment, defending other athletes and other storylines, but I am simply not interested.</p>\n<p>I have been covering his story since even before his arrival, talking to people from all over the country and seeing how this diminutive man is writing a new chapter of sports and culture in America. I keep getting texts and emails from friends who have never before cared about the game. I have interviewed folks from all corners of America and chatted to professional athletes and coaches from different institutions. I have talked to Messi himself and seen what's orbiting around him.</p>\n<p>Simply put, what's happening now is spectacular.</p>\n<p>Things will slow down at some point. It's only natural for them to do so. After all, Messi will have to take a break; he already showed some fatigue this week, and I don't even know if he will start on Saturday against the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=190\">New York Red Bulls</a>. Argentina will also require his services next month, and then there is the offseason.</p>\n<p>But know this: the wave of Lionel Messi will stop only when he decides it stops. For the rest of us mere mortals? We can only hope to witness and enjoy its overwhelming force whenever it comes to town.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<h3>To Postecoglou: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a>'s ultimate underdog</h3>\n<p>When Ange Postecoglou was 4 or 5 years old, his father lost his business in Greece after the military coup in 1967, forcing his family to emigrate to Australia. After enduring a monthlong boat ride, they finally arrived at their new home.</p>\n<p>\"People sort of misinterpret the immigration story, you often hear, they say, 'People immigrate to another country for a better life,' and that's not the story of what an immigrant is,\" the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=367\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager <a href=\"https://twitter.com/footballdaily/status/1666036501870673921\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a>. \"An immigrant goes to another country to provide opportunities for the next generation.\"</p>\n<p>I can't tell you how much I relate to this sentiment, but most importantly, this quote is the ethos Postecoglou lives by. His parents' selfless sacrifice is something that is always with him. He owes everything to them, and in fact, his entire philosophy on the pitch is an homage to his immigrant story.</p>\n<p>He has been quoted saying how he loves coaching teams that his father would appreciate: hungry, noble and not self-serving. Postecoglou is honest and confident without the weight of arrogance. His resiliency is born out of a fighting spirit that originated in that boat to Australia. He is football's James J. Braddock, unable to turn his back on a challenge and always fighting with an unapologetically blue-collar mentality.</p>\n<p>As a result, this now applies to Spurs, too.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>In a land of egos and self-serving machinations, I really like Postecoglou, who reminds us of the ultimate values of life through his management. While success with Tottenham depends largely on the boardroom and chairman Daniel Levy, make no mistake: I expect a fighting spirit from Spurs this season as every player will do everything in their power to live up to the manager's values and huge expectations.</p>\n<p>Postecoglou is a fighter, but he is also a believer in empathy, hard work and dedication; all of the required ingredients needed for a Tottenham side who for so long have needed an identity. They now have one thanks to Postecoglou.</p>\n<p>Forget <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/142200/harry-kane\">Harry Kane</a>. This is the man who can truly help Spurs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>OFFSIDE</h2>\n<h3>Saudi spending should prompt transfer window rethink</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a> manager Mikel Arteta is correct. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/KSA.1\">Saudi Pro League</a>'s transfer calendar, which doesn't end until Sept. 20, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38257200/arteta-urges-saudi-arabia-transfer-window-close-earlier-help-premier-league-clubs\">is an added headache to European clubs</a>, whose own window closes at the beginning of the month. Those extra weeks, fretting about potentially losing a player who can't be replaced in the transfer market until January, can prove anxiety-inducing.</p>\n<p>\"I think we have to change that [the window closing on Sept. 20],\" Arteta said on Friday. \"It is a lot of people involved in that process and they would have a say, the ownership would do the same. It would be on the table like with any offer and you have to look at it. The only thing I'm saying is it's not ideal because they are a competitor.\"</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=364\">Liverpool</a> manager Jurgen Klopp, who has also been dealing with Saudi interest in his star <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/173896/mohamed-salah\">Mohamed Salah</a>, also talked about this issue, suggesting that everyone should operate using the same calendar: \"If [Saudi] want to be part of the system then you do your business at the same time.\"</p>\n<p>The whole idea of transfer windows needs significant reimagining, and potentially they should be abolished altogether.</p>\n<p>The current format in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a> was introduced in 2002-03, and before that, players could be transferred throughout the season until March 31. The concept was originally introduced to protect clubs' rosters and financial stability. Now, though? It's a circus for agents and their contemporaries, encouraging moves and influencing rhetoric to push for either a better contract or a transfer elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The transfer window isn't a window as such, more of a collection of doors through which agents can push their clients.</p>\n<p>What if we completely got rid of the January window and closed the summer's by July 15? This could help clubs properly plan for the upcoming season and create a culture of respected and protected preseasons.</p>\n<p>If there is a serious injury during the summer, there could perhaps be a way to replace the player under certain circumstances and with a set of limitations such as restricting additions to academy or domestic-based players. If the football calendar ever lightens for players, fewer injuries would occur and a healthier, calmer summer could take place.</p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<p>Nothing is perfect and money will always talk, but stricter guidelines could help everyone fall under the same calendar and protocol. This could also improve the relationship between players and employers.</p>\n<p>Today's transfer circus is damaging, unnecessary and pushing us further away from why we're here in the first place: the game itself.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final word</h2>\n<p>Finally! As a result of pressure, women's teams goalkeeping kits, including <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=5159\">England</a>'s tremendous No. 1, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/248768/mary-earps\">Mary Earps</a>', will be available for fans to buy, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38250291/nike-u-turns-sell-goalkeeper-jerseys-earps-outcry\">Nike announced on Thursday</a>.</p>\n<p>After being unable to purchase them throughout the competition, a petition with more than 150,000 signatures had been circulating and the Beaverton, Oregon-based sportswear giant was forced to abide.</p>\n<p>\"We recognize that during the tournament we didn't serve those fans who wished to show their passion and support to the squad's goalkeepers,\" Nike's statement read. \"We are committed to retailing women's goalkeeping jerseys for major tournaments in the future.\"</p>\n<p>This never needed to be a thing, especially in a World Cup year. Nike learned its lesson and hopefully all brands learn a valuable lesson: know your customer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n\n\n<p>Are you only as good as your worst player, or are you only as bad as your best player? These are the two sides of a nerdy debate about how soccer works that's been simmering among weirdos like me for the past decade.</p>\n\n\n<p>On the side of the first question, we have the authors of \"The Numbers Game,\" Chris Anderson and David Sally. In their book, they put forth the \"weak-link theory\" of soccer: that the qualities of each individual player don't just get added up and divided by 11 to produce an aggregate of team performance, but rather that the qualities multiply with each other. So, great players make other great players even greater, while bad players can make great players average. One hundred multiplied by zero is, well, zero.</p>\n\n\n<p>Through various analyses, Anderson and Sally found that improving your best player by 10% will roughly result in a five-point improvement from season to season. Except, they found that improving your worst player by 10% will lead to a nine-point improvement. If you believe that soccer teams are complex systems -- a multi-dimensional interplay between 11 players making thousands of decisions across every 90-minute match -- then the logic makes sense.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, if you've watched <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> play for <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20232\">Inter Miami CF</a>, then that logic makes <em>no</em> sense. Arguably the best soccer player in the world joined what was inarguably the worst soccer team in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a>, and they've outscored their opponents 25-11, won the Leagues Cup and remain undefeated through Messi's eight games with the club.</p>\n\n\n<p>This all raises an interesting strategic question that's rarely applied to soccer. In the NFL or the NBA, you'll often hear about or see teams doing everything they can to shut down one star player, whether it be a receiver or a star scorer. \"We're going to make someone else beat us,\" coaches say. Given its dynamic nature, soccer doesn't really work like that, but considering how much better Messi is than everyone else, should an MLS team try to completely neutralize Messi at the expense of protecting against all of his teammates?</p>\n\n\n<p>And if they did, what might it look like?</p>\n\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n<h2>What happens when Messi loses?</h2>\n\n\n<p>According to Stats Perform, Messi played 434 league games in Europe from 2010 onward. His record: 316 wins, 44 losses and 74 draws. I'm not sure which framing makes those numbers seem more ridiculous: that he won 73% of his matches or that he lost only 10% of them? Point being: Lionel Messi's soccer teams have rarely ever lost soccer games.</p>\n\n\n<p>But is there anything that all of those losses have in common with each other?</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p>What makes Messi the greatest soccer player ever -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/sports/insider/soccer/insider/story/_/id/35259622/lionel-messi-world-cup-proves-best-male-athlete-ever\">and maybe the greatest athlete</a> -- is that he not only produced goals and assists at a much higher and much more consistent clip than any modern player, but he also was better at dribbling than anyone and better at playing balls into the penalty area than anyone. He was also better at aiding in possession play to move the ball up the field than anyone else, too. And so, unlike a low-touch-but-high-impact player like <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe\">Kylian Mbappé</a> or <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/253989/erling-haaland\">Erling Haaland</a>, you'll pretty much never get a game in which Messi doesn't have some kind of positive impact on proceedings with the ball at his feet.</p>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it seems like a large part of the battle here is just to make it so Messi is having that impact further away from the goal. You're just not going to ever have a game where Messi isn't getting on the ball, so if you can force him to drop deep and try to dictate play from the midfield, that, historically, has been a big win -- even if it meant he picked apart your backline from deep and you still ended up getting annihilated.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this heatmap of the end locations of all of Messi's passes in wins, you can see that he's constantly driving the ball into that left half-space at the top of the box, and then he's constantly hitting diagonals into the left side of the penalty area:</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/0824/r1215145_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Now, these images are a little tricky to compare, given that there are way more passes in wins because there are so many more wins, but just focus on the areas of density in this next image. There's a cluster of passes near the center circle -- a good chunk of which comes from the fact that Messi was taking more kickoffs in losses because his team was conceding more goals -- but then there's not as much concentration in the left half-space. And more than that, there are fewer passes being completed into the box: 4.9 per 90 minutes in losses, 5.3 wins.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/0824/r1215149_1186x791_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>The heatmaps of his touches tell a similar story, too.</p>\n\n\n<p>In wins:</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/0824/r1215146_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>And in losses:</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/0824/r1215147_1186x790_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p>In wins, he's able to camp out on top of the box in the center of the field; in losses, his distribution of touches is scattered more across the width of the box. And then there are just way fewer touches inside the box: 8.0 per 90 in wins, 5.5 in losses. On top of that, there are fewer shots -- 5.3 in wins, 4.8 in losses -- while there are more passes into the final third in losses (8.7) than in wins (8.1). He's also more creative in losses (0.24 expected assists) than in wins (0.19).</p>\n\n\n<p>In that sense, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a> executed on a solid gameplan Wednesday night, as the teams that have beaten Messi in the past have turned him into more of a passer than a shooter.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"[Messi] always has a response for every moment of the game, regardless of the difficulties he has,\" Inter Miami manager Tata Martino said after the game. \"I think that today he did it more as an assister and not as a finisher.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Of course, as Cincy eventually found out, just because something is a \"better\" option doesn't necessarily make it a good one. Messi had two assists in the second half to cap a two-goal comeback, and Inter Miami eventually won in penalties.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Can you neutralize Messi?</h2>\n\n\n<p>So, let's say you saw Messi terrorize the Leagues Cup with his goal scoring, and then you saw him pick apart the first-place team in MLS with his passing. You weren't comfortable with either scenario, so you opted for a third way: completely sacrifice the rest of your team in order to make sure Messi almost never touches the ball.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>The first question: Is this even possible?</p>\n\n\n<p>Much of Messi's brilliance comes from his understanding and anticipation of space. He walks better than most players run; this is not a glib statement, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/messi-walks-better-than-most-players-run/\" target=\"_blank\">this is scientific fact</a>! There was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/InterMiami/comments/15x8xvh/why_does_messi_walk_alot_well_here_you_go/\" target=\"_blank\">a \"viral TikTok\"</a> -- I can't even begin to explain how embarrassed I am to type those words, in that order -- from Miami's Leagues Cup final win, where Messi is just kind of wandering around, barely moving, is he injured? Is he alive? Then all of a sudden he sprints to the left corner of the penalty area, and bam, the ball is in the upper corner.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"One thing Messi told me is to stand still more,\" 19-year-old Miami midfielder <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/229289/david-ruiz\">David Ruiz</a> said after the Leagues Cup final win against <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18986\">Nashville SC</a>. \"You want to run for every ball, look for space to have it more, but he has told me to stay still in my position and the ball will come to me. I tried it and it came off. I was more patient.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Part of Messi's standing these days, at age 36, occurs when the other team has the ball. He's constantly staking out and then occupying high-value positions where he can then receive the ball as soon as the opposition loses it. So, in order to mark Messi out of a game, a team would first need to sacrifice one of their attackers to follow Messi around even when they have the ball. Otherwise, he'd easily lose his marker and constantly find the ball in transition moments.</p>\n\n\n<p>Would that be enough? No, definitely not. Only Messi knows where he's going, and he knows where to go better than anyone else. A constant marker would definitely limit Messi's pure on-ball impact, but he'd still get plenty of touches, especially as the game wore on and this player started to lose energy.</p>\n\n\n<p>One way to counteract that would be to sub the marker off at halftime and bring someone else in, but even that wouldn't be enough; Messi frequently does amazing things when defenders are covering him across various situations in every game. This wouldn't fully eliminate his impact.</p>\n\n\n<p>Now, you could just have two players follow him around for the whole game, but then you're playing 9-v-11 with the ball, and you're still playing 9-v-10 without it if we accept that this approach eliminates Messi's impact -- and I'm not even sure that it does. But let's take a somewhat more conservative view of this.</p>\n\n\n<p>You have one guy follow Messi around all game, but then you also tell your other defenders to defend Messi how they normally might in a game: pick him up if he floats into your area. We'll call this a \"hybrid double-team\" -- you've got the one guy following him around wherever he goes in and out of possession, and then you've got whatever other defender is in that area bracketing him as a second defender.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi registered a pair of assists as Inter Miami came from two goals down to beat FC Cincinnati in the U.S. Open Cup semifinals on Wednesday.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Let's say that this works, right? You make a sub at halftime, and you use two of your most athletic players to follow him around, 45 minutes each. Throw in the second defender, and Messi just doesn't touch the ball much at all. You can't stop him from finding possession after fouls or corner kicks, but let's say you limit those, and you also avoid giving up any free kicks around the box, which almost seem like they're penalties for Messi right now.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you do that, we'll call it playing down 1.5 men. It's not quite two men down, because you're eliminating Messi and that second defender is only joining in defensively, but it's also more than just playing a man down. So, we'll split the difference. Is that worth it?</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://thepowerofgoals.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-red-cards-effect-soccer-match.html\" target=\"_blank\">work by the analyst Mark Taylor</a>, if a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a> team gets a red card in the first minute of a game, it's worth about 1.45 goals over the course of a match. I don't quite know the best way to calculate that second half-man, but I'm going to add another half onto that total. (I feel OK about this because I think there might be an exponential effect to losing players from the 11, rather than just a linear one.) So, if we do a little rounding, we'll say that essentially playing a man and a half down for a full game is worth 2.15 goals per game: 1.45 plus another 0.7.</p>\n\n\n<p>In MLS this season, the best per-game goal differential is <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/21812/st-louis-city-sc\">St. Louis City</a>'s at plus-0.8, while the worst is the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=184\">Colorado Rapids</a> down at minus-0.8. In other words, the difference between the best and worst teams in MLS is 1.6 goals per game. The cost of marking Messi out of existence is that, plus another half goal or so.</p>\n\n\n<p>That's absurd, and I'm not sure it's <em>not</em> worth it.</p>\n\n\n<p>Without Messi, Inter Miami were the worst team in the league. With him, can we be sure they're not a half a goal better than whoever the previous best team was? They're probably not, but pretty much any time there's even been the sliver of a possibility that Messi might do something previously unthinkable, he's gone out and done it. You've seen these first eight games. Has anything really changed?</p>\n\n",

  "<p><video1></p>\n\n\n<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">Major League Soccer</a> didn't have to wait long for its cherished <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a> moment.</p>\n\n\n<p>On Saturday night in front of a packed crowd at Geodis Park, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/20232/inter-miami-cf\">Inter Miami</a> won the Leagues Cup, prevailing over <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18986\">Nashville SC</a> via penalties 10-9 after the teams finished 90 minutes tied at one goal apiece. At that point, the celebrations began.</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p>Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham -- who'd endured an odyssey just to get the team in Miami -- was hugging everyone in sight. That included defender <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/316269/ian-fray\">Ian Fray</a>, who had torn his ACL for the third time just minutes into Messi's first match against Cruz Azul in July.</p>\n\n\n<p>Later, Messi sauntered over to the awards stand, and after receiving a peck on the cheek from co-owner Jorge Mas -- the man who had engineered the Argentine's move stateside -- he took home the tournament MVP trophy. He scored 10 goals in the competition, including Miami's tally on this night. He later called over <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/183778/deandre-yedlin\">DeAndre Yedlin</a>, and the two held up the absurdly large Leagues Cup; the confetti rained down, the players started dancing and the party was on. It later spilled over into manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino's postgame news conference, with players bursting in and dousing him in champagne.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It was a very difficult game,\" Beckham said. \"But it was just our night tonight.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>As much as the whole idea of the Leagues Cup has been criticized (expanded this year to include all 47 Liga MX and MLS teams), it meant a ton to Inter Miami. A month ago, with the team having the fewest points in all of MLS, it seemed debatable as to whether one player -- or even three of them -- could turn Miami's fortunes around. But after seven victories, including two by penalty shootout, the Herons have raised a trophy for the first time in their history.</p>\n\n\n<p>To put into context just how rapid Inter Miami's ascent has been, Beckham had to wait until his fifth season with the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=187\">LA Galaxy</a> to hoist his first trophy, the 2011 MLS Cup. Messi has done it in less than five weeks, and there could be more to come.</p>\n\n\n<h2>'We know that this guy is magical'</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Messi has been with Inter Miami barely a full month, yet his arrival -- and his prodigious talent -- have lifted the club to its first trophy.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Before kickoff, the extent to which Messi has permeated the consciousness of fans is evident. Everywhere one looks, there are Messi jerseys of all kinds: <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a>, Inter Miami.</p>\n<p>OK, maybe not all kinds; there are no <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/160\">PSG</a>-era Messi jerseys to be found.</p>\n\n\n<p>The home fans are aware of what's on tap as well. How could they not be? Across the street from Geodis Park, Nashville's home venue, is a barbershop owned by Jars of Clay guitarist Stephen Mason, aka Soccer Moses. Every game, he dresses up as Moses and holds up a sign that reads \"Let My People Goal.\"</p>\n<p>This time around, he's set up a Moses vs. Messi-ah clash, and says he has gotten his transformation from Stephen to Moses down to \"about three minutes.\" He also has started his own march to the match, appropriately titled \"The Exodus.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"The liturgy is still developing,\" he quips, but it has made considerable progress. On the marquee adorning his barbershop, The Handsomizer, Mason has added his own special touch. It says: \"Welcome Lionel Messi -- the Argentinian <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/174548/hany-mukhtar\">Hany Mukhtar</a>,\" an ode to Nashville SC's own creative force and reigning MLS MVP.</p>\n\n<p><inline4></p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the day, Clay Trainum, the authority on all things Nashville soccer history, sits in an eatery in the southern part of Nashville and prays that the final doesn't go to penalties. After shootout wins over FC Cincinnati and Club America, he feels NSC's shootout karma has been exhausted. Little did he know how prescient his concerns would turn out to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Miami fans present are feeling the love, supremely confident that the side would raise its first trophy. And why not? With the exception of a penalty shootout win over <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a>, Miami has laid waste to its competition. The depressing days of earlier this season are a distant memory, replaced by the team's breathtaking play in reaching the final.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We know that this guy [Messi] is magical,\" says Chris Moramarco, a founding member of Miami's Vice City 1896 supporters group who drove 13 hours to attend the match. \"We've seen him do it over and over. We see that his intensity doesn't drop. It doesn't matter who he's playing for. This is what he does.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"You can see that this guy transcends culture, nationalities. And I think that's the beauty of what we're about to witness.\"</p>\n\n\n<h2>'You can see they love the game'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Twenty-four hours before kickoff, Miami GM Chris Henderson is channeling his inner John \"Hannibal\" Smith of \"A-Team\" fame. He loves it when a plan comes together -- it is a vital part of his job, after all -- but the degree to which Miami's capture of Messi, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a> has worked has exceeded even his expectations. Granted, Inter Miami's plan ran deeper than just bringing in the aforementioned trio -- Henderson did what he could to bring in players who were good on the ball, the better to maximize Messi's influence once he arrived.</p>\n\n\n<p>All that said, the rapidity with which the trio has assimilated to all things MLS has been astonishing. So has the ability of the team's existing players to adapt to their new teammates. There were some hiccups in Miami's vision: Injuries to midfielders <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/198531/jean-mota\">Jean Mota</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/235893/gregore\">Gregore</a> meant that the team's young players got thrown into the deep end sooner than expected.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We suffered a lot early this year,\" Henderson says. \"All our young guys got a lot of opportunities with these injuries. We didn't see it in results, but this experience really helped their confidence, and a player like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/356358/benjamin-cremaschi\">[Benji] Cremaschi</a> or <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/316344/noah-allen\">Noah Allen</a>, just being able to get these minutes and then integrate with the team, has been really good.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"The speed of Miami's turnaround has been a sight to behold, but that's what happens when you bring in proven world-class winners like Messi, Busquets and Alba. It raises the overall levels, and from there, good things happen.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Granted, you're talking about players at the extreme end of the talent scale, but even manager Tata Martino said there would need to be an adjustment period. Yet the tranquility that has accompanied their arrival has given them the calm to focus on the task at hand. For Henderson, the adaptation period was near instantaneous.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It was really the first training session,\" Henderson says. \"Alba came a little bit after, but Messi and Busquets stepped on the field, and instantly we were creating 10 times the amount of chances in attack because of these guys. You can see the difference in all the players around them. Some guys were nervous the first couple training sessions, but the level and the confidence of the rest of the group, and just the quality that they brought, it really did surprise me.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>It helps when a superstar comes in with the right attitude, as too often in MLS, players from abroad have arrived thinking they could just operate on cruise control. Not this trio. That was vital given that Miami was -- and still is -- in last place when league play resumes.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"They're asking, 'What tournaments do we play? How can we win trophies? What's the pathway to get there?'\" Henderson says. \"They wanted to know how they could win and how they could help our team turn around. That is a huge sign. And just the way they come out and play every day. You can see they love the game. It was really just a transition for them just coming in and changing the whole mentality and the whole level of the group.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n<p>The magic of Messi & Co. has left the eyeballs of observers so transfixed that the arrival of another Argentine, Martino, has been overlooked to a degree.</p>\n\n\n<p>Martino ticked a multitude of managerial boxes for the Miami project when he joined Inter Miami on July 10. There is his previous working relationship with Messi, Busquets and Alba when he was at Barcelona, plus his time with Messi as manager of Argentina. There's also the success Martino had with Atlanta United. It all serves to give him a unique skill set of having managed the world's best while also understanding the vagaries of MLS, from the arcane roster rules to the travel and weather challenges.</p>\n<p>And perhaps more ominously for the league, the packed schedule of games has limited Martino's time with his players on the training field. He hasn't really sunk his teeth into some of the deeper issues -- mostly on defense -- affecting his team.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I'm really looking forward to a period where he can really start to work on some of the things he wants to,\" Henderson says.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The aura prevails ... barely</h2>\n\n\n<p>Nashville's Gary Smith has seen a fair bit during his time in the league as well. He won an MLS Cup with an unfashionable <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=184\">Colorado Rapids</a> team in 2010, while his steady hand has helped Nashville reach the postseason in every year of its brief existence. He's not one to get overly excited about a particular run of games, or the emergence of a player. But even he is in awe of what he's seen from Inter Miami's transformation over the past month.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I've been astounded by what the team and the organization have been able to achieve in such a short space of time,\" he says before the match, referring to Inter Miami. \"The way that they've taken care of just about every problem they've run into so far has, has been quite amazing.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Miami rushes to celebrate with goalkeeper Drake Callender, right, who made a couple of vital late stops before saving the crucial penalty during the shootout.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Smith even acknowledges that he's seen something akin to an intimidation factor that the league hasn't quite come to grips with yet.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"You're talking about the greatest [player] in any sport. There's an aura that's wrapped around that -- there has to be,\" he says. \"There's not just a talent. The talent on its own, of course, is good enough, but the aura of that person not only affects, I'm sure, opponents, and to keep a clear focus and vision of what you're after as an opposing team is vital. But it's certainly affecting officials as well.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>It's affected the players most of all. Miami's talent infusion has produced a boost almost steroid-like in its speed, and it's resulted in a new reality on the field: The window by which teams can get away with mistakes has narrowed considerably.</p>\n\n\n<p>Errors are now punished. Ruthlessly. If a keeper gets his angles wrong or his footwork is off, Messi is there to take advantage. If Busquets isn't closed down and has ample time to pick out a killer pass, he will. If a team coughs up a free-kick opportunity, well, that's practically a tap-in for Messi.</p>\n\n\n<p>Yet Smith is not about to willingly play the part of the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters of Messi & Co., and as it turned out, Nashville doesn't. After a feisty opening period to Saturday's Leagues Cup final, Messi takes advantage of a momentary bit of chaos in the 23rd minute, when a wayward clearance falls to him at the top of the box. That allows him to dance around Nashville defender <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/183764/walker-zimmerman\">Walker Zimmerman</a> with the help of a slight deflection, and he fires past <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/246389/elliot-panicco://\">Elliot Panicco</a> in the Nashville goal.</p>\n\n\n<p>In previous matches, Miami jumping out ahead was akin to running downhill, but Nashville is one of the most disciplined sides in the league, the players sticking to their task. Their 57th-minute equalizer is as ugly as Messi's was sublime, as a header from <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/211678/fafa-picault\">Fafà Picault</a> is deflected and then ricochets into the net off Miami goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/245083/drake-callender\">Drake Callender</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n\n<p>There are stretches when Miami is made to suffer and its passes aren't as crisp. But then the Herons come agonizingly close to winning the match. Messi, for once, isn't quite as clinical as he normally is, hitting the post in the 71st minute. Substitute Leo Campana has a clear opportunity in second-half stoppage time, but tries to chip Panicco and then with his attempt going wide, hits the post with his follow-up attempt. Then in the shootout, <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121714/victor-ulloa\">Victor Ulloa</a> could have won it, only to have his attempt saved.</p>\n\n\n<p>But like much of this Leagues Cup, the soccer gods continue to smile on Miami. Callender turns hero, first saving a pair of shots in second-half stoppage time, then converting his attempt and saving Panicco's, and the Herons have their first trophy.</p>\n\n\n<p>One question that has surrounded Miami since Messi's arrival is obvious: How long can they sustain this run of form?</p>\n\n\n<p>At present, there doesn't appear to be an end in sight. They've won at home. They've gotten results on the road, looking like the consummate favorites throughout.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"When we walk into the places now, we expect to win,\" defender DeAndre Yedlin says. \"I can't say that was the fact every time we played before. I think just the overall feeling in the team, the confidence of the team, right now we're in a good moment.</p>\n<p>\"It's strange because we're still kind of learning on the go, but it's good that we were able to win this while still learning.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>There's hope in youth as well. Eighteen-year-old Cremaschi is soaking in the master class he's getting from his new teammates every day and isn't daunted by the pressure of living up to their expectations. In fact, he's welcoming it.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Obviously, there's pressure trying to satisfy these types of players, but I try to focus on me, on what I could do to help them, and I try to not play with pressure,\" he says.</p>\n\n\n<p>But for the next 24 hours, Miami's focus will be on the trophy now in its possession.</p>\n\n\n<p>Beckham says, \"Tonight is a night that we are going to enjoy.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Certainly, we'll work with Concacaf on so many of the other operational things and whether that's officiating or anything else, which, by the way, I think was much better than I think the officials got credit for.</p>\n<p>\"Ultimately these are all things that we're going to do in the offseason and sit down with my counterpart, [<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/MEX.1\">Liga MX</a> president] Mikel Arriola, and think about what the future is going to hold for us.\"</p>\n<p>Garber also said that MLS would continue to be about more than just one player, even one as transcendent as Messi.</p>\n<p>\"It is about the foundation,\" he said. \"It is about the core of what we are embedded into our community.

He began his quest to put an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> expansion team in Miami in 2014, only to suffer numerous setbacks in terms of finding additional investors, as well as a path to a stadium deal. But his fortunes began to change in 2017 when he brought on Jorge and Jose Mas as co-owners. The three men then bought out Masayoshi Son and Marcelo Claure in 2021.</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"David Beckham holds the Leagues Cup alongside Inter Miami CF co-owners Jorge Mas, left, and Jose Mas, right.\"></p>\n<p>\"It's been a long journey for me,\" Beckham said. \"But a few years back, I found the perfect partners to be on this journey with me, and the perfect family, and that was the Mas family.

They care about the club, everybody that's in the club, and that means something to me.</p>\n<p>\"So we started this journey and it's been a long one.

We've seen thrilling high-scoring results, an outcome flipped on its head after players were called back to retake a final round of penalties, lengthy weather delays, stunning <em>golazos</em>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@realsaltlakeofficial/video/7263318671584513323\" target=\"_blank\">a raccoon storming through a press box</a>, and of course, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38139809/tigres-no-1-guzman-distracts-penalty-taker-magic-show\">a goalkeeper literally doing magic tricks in the middle of a penalty shootout</a>.</p>\n<p>It's been a highly enjoyable few weeks and on Saturday, we'll see who will lift the interleague trophy when <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18986\">Nashville SC</a> host Messi's Miami in the blockbuster championship match. Earlier in the day, as an appetizer, the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=10739\">Philadelphia Union</a> will host <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/220/monterrey\">Monterrey</a> in the tournament's third-place game.</p>\n\n\n<p>Summarizing the competition is no easy task, especially when you consider the constant supply of fireworks and eccentricity that has been on display. That said, clear talking points and lessons have been gained and ahead of the weekend's conclusion, here are a few winners and losers of the lively 2023 edition of the Leagues Cup.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Winners</h2>\n\n\n<h3>Messi mania in Miami and MLS</h3>\n\n\n<p>Who would have guessed that the greatest player of all-time would have been a success both on and off the field?</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi has scored nine goals and added four assists in his first six games with Inter Miami.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>From the minute Messi first stepped onto the pitch in the tournament's opener between Miami and <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/218/cruz-azul\">Cruz Azul</a>, to the buildup to Saturday's championship match, the World Cup winner has been a massive triumph for Miami and MLS. With nine goals and four assists in just six games played, the 36-year-old (along with new teammates such as <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121021/jordi-alba\">Jordi Alba</a>) has helped transform the worst team in MLS to an immediate powerhouse that has now qualified for the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup.</p>\n\n\n<p>Whether it be in the stands, with celebrities like LeBron James and Kim Kardashian in attendance, or on TV screens, attention on MLS has soared. Ticket prices are through the roof for Messi's games and according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jorge__Mas/status/1689758782828556288\" target=\"_blank\">a social media post from Miami owner Jorge Mas</a> last week, subscribers to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV have more than doubled since Messi's arrival.</p>\n\n\n<p>By Saturday, the Messi spotlight could grow even brighter with a possible first trophy with his new team.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Liga MX optimists</h3>\n\n\n<p>Living in the shadow of Messi and his MLS impact, Liga MX clubs are dealing with a mixed bag of feelings with no representation in the final.</p>\n\n\n<p>If we're looking at the glass half-empty, Mexican media and fans will feel justified by their complaints that Liga MX teams have been falling behind in recent years. For those looking for examples of stagnation, arguments have been made that no Liga MX teams in the final and just two overall in the quarterfinal stage point to an ongoing mismanagement of the Mexican top flight.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>However, if we crunch the numbers for individual Liga MX vs. MLS results at the Leagues Cup, the glass does tend to look half-full. Playing as the constantly traveling visitors, Liga MX teams have so far gone 17W-12D-17L (90 minutes only, not including penalties). MLS teams at home only won those Liga MX matchups outright 36.9% of the time.</p>\n\n\n<p>That's actually a fantastic sign for the competitiveness of Liga MX that isn't talked about enough. Even when you take away Mexican title favorites like <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/227/america\">Club America</a>, Monterrey and <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/232/tigres-uanl\">Tigres</a>, Liga MX's middle-to-lower-tier teams held a 9W-10D-15L away record vs. MLS clubs.</p>\n\n\n<p>As an aside, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38162737/liga-mx-arriola-talks-leagues-cup-libertadores-transfers\">in a recent exclusive interview with ESPN</a>, Liga MX president Mikel Arriola did leave the door open to the possibility of hosting Leagues Cup matches in <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=203\">Mexico</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Nashville</h3>\n\n\n<p>Keeping the previous section in mind, what Nashville have done looks all the more impressive. With the caveat of their home-field advantage, the Tennessee club found knockout-round success against both America and Monterrey, two Mexican clubs that were pre-tournament favorites to win it all.</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the round of 32, Nashville also had to surpass rivals <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=18267\">FC Cincinnati</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"To be able to come through this tournament beating Cincinnati, beating Club America, beating a good Minnesota team handily [5-0 in the quarterfinals] and then obviously beating Monterrey, we should be full of confidence,\" club captain <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/75577/dax-mccarty\">Dax McCarty</a> <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/nashville-sc-hold-no-fear-after-vanquishing-liga-mx-power-monterrey\" target=\"_blank\">told the league's website</a> after defeating Monterrey 2-0 in Tuesday's semifinal. \"I can tell you right now, there's no one in that locker room right now that's afraid or scared of the moment and scared to play this Miami team.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>While most of the American soccer world has been focusing on Messi's every move, Nashville deserve a huge amount of credit for their run to the final. This is a team that joined the league alongside Miami in 2020 to much less fanfare, and yet they're now on the cusp of a first-ever trophy, led by the two goals and five assists from game-changing attacker <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/174548/hany-mukhtar\">Hany Mukhtar</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>And at the very least, like Miami, they've officially qualified for next year's CONCACAF Champions Cup for the very first time.</p>\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/222/queretaro\">Queretaro</a>'s Cinderella run</h3>\n\n\n<p>On paper, Queretaro shouldn't have even been included in the Leagues Cup conversation. Were it not for the ongoing pause on promotion/relegation in Mexico's top flight, <em>Los Gallos Blancos</em> would currently be playing in the second division.</p>\n\n\n<p>Heading into the tournament as the team with the lowest market value in Liga MX and MLS, according to Transfermarkt, Queretaro not only made it out of the group stage, but somehow finished in the quarterfinals. In fact, they made things difficult for 2022 MLS Cup finalists Philadelphia Union last week, narrowly missing a semifinal spot after a 2-1 loss after an injury-time goal for the hosts.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Queretaro were among the least-fancied Liga MX sides in Leagues Cup, and yet only Monterrey went further than Los Gallos Blancos.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Playing a defensive-minded approach from manager and former player Mauro Gerk, as opposed to the typical intense attack-heavy style championed by most Liga MX clubs, Queretaro found success on their own terms as they outpaced all but one Mexican team.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Losers</h2>\n\n\n<h3>Canadian clubs</h3>\n\n\n<p>Often overlooked in the U.S. vs. Mexico rivalry that encompasses both clubs and national teams, <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=206\">Canada</a> can at times feel like a third wheel in North American soccer. And yet when handed a chance to steer the narrative in their direction at the Leagues Cup, MLS's three Canadian sides didn't do much to steal headlines.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=7318\">Toronto FC</a>, with zero points, were knocked out in the group stage. <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/9720/cf-montreal\">CF Montreal</a>, with two points, also suffered a group-stage exit. Only the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=9727\">Vancouver Whitecaps</a> made it through to the next round after a second-place finish in their group, but once there, they were quickly pushed out after a round-of-32 penalty shootout with Tigres.</p>\n\n\n<p>Barring an unexpected title push this season in MLS (Vancouver as long shots?), Canadian teams will need to wait until at least 2024 to get top billing over the U.S. and Mexico focus.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<h3>Mexico's <i>cuatro grandes</i></h3>\n\n\n<p>The largest fan bases in Liga MX and likely in all of North America? Check. Long-heralded histories that could provide a boost in the Leagues Cup? Check. Silverware or progress made in that Leagues Cup tournament? Well, about that ...</p>\n\n\n<p>Mexico's traditional \"big four\" of America, <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/219/guadalajara\">Chivas</a>, Cruz Azul and <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/233/pumas-unam\">Pumas</a> will probably want to quickly move on from their summer performances. With a chance to show MLS clubs and new Liga MX powerhouses like Monterrey and Tigres that they could thrive in an international competition, all four teams ultimately fell short of their own expectations.</p>\n\n\n<p>For Chivas, who entered the Leagues Cup with a promising 3W-0D-0L start to the Liga MX season, the Guadalajara giants collapsed with two consecutive losses and a group-stage exit. Things only went slightly better for Pumas and Cruz Azul, both of whom were rapidly knocked out in the round of 32. Cruz Azul, facing behind-the-scenes turmoil with ownership and staff, later <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38151988/cruz-azul-sack-ricardo-ferretti-leagues-cup-defeat\">fired coach Ricardo \"Tuca\" Ferretti</a> after falling to <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Club America went a step further into the round of 16, but for a team and organization that prides themselves as being consistent title contenders, anything short of a final appearance is a failure. Sure, part of their exit was due to a controversial retaking of a penalty shootout that had initially gone in their favor, but they only have themselves to blame for putting themselves in that position to begin with.</p>\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"/soccer/team?id=20906\">Austin FC</a> and the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=187\">LA Galaxy</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>Teams could be forgiven for being knocked out in the group stage. With the countless variables coming into play for a tournament that was expanded to all Liga MX and MLS clubs for the first time, it wasn't a surprise to see the occasional upset or shocking result.</p>\n\n\n<p>But when you finish last in your group with zero points, and also with the added advantage of hosting all of your group-stage matches, that's a different conversation. Austin and the Galaxy were the two teams to do that this summer.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo caption=\"Riqui Puig's LA Galaxy were held pointless in their two group-stage games played in front of their home crowd.\"></p>\n\n\n<p>While the Galaxy imploded in spectacular fashion after scoring a late own-goal and allowing an injury-time winner from Vancouver that ended the California club's group-stage run, Austin were embarrassed twice in a row at home in losses to Liga MX minnows <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/20702/mazatlan-fc\">Mazatlan</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/17851/fc-juarez\">FC Juarez</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"This is disappointing, this is really disappointing, there's no other way to put it,\" Austin's <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/171547/ethan-finlay\">Ethan Finlay</a> said after his side were eliminated from contention. \"We had to win one game out of two.\"</p>\n\n\n<h3>Tired, out-of-form clubs returning to regular seasons</h3>\n\n\n<p>With both Liga MX and MLS returning to regular season play this weekend (for clubs not involved in the final or third-place matches), time will tell who the Leagues Cup will hurt more: teams who were knocked out early, but subsequently had longer breaks, or teams who are more in rhythm but with more mileage in their legs.</p>\n\n\n<p>For struggling teams in both leagues such as the <a href=\"/soccer/club/_/id/184/colorado-rapids\">Colorado Rapids</a>, Toronto, the Galaxy, <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/231/puebla\">Puebla</a> and <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/229/necaxa\">Necaxa</a>, it's tough to imagine that poor performances this summer will provide a boost in the return to regular-season play. On the other end of the spectrum, it'll also be interesting to see what group-stage exits mean for Liga MX league-leaders Chivas and Western Conference leaders <a href=\"/soccer/team/_/id/21812/st-louis-city-sc\">St. Louis City SC</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Also of note are Monterrey and Philadelphia, both of whom will be gutted that they won't be fighting for silverware on Saturday. Although the Union still have a CONCACAF Champions Cup spot that's up for grabs for the third-place finisher, could the extra minutes and exertion in the Leagues Cup hurt their regular-season run? Will Monterrey's constant traveling and injuries gained in the competition drop their morale in the returning Apertura season?</p>\n\n",

He's filling stadiums, he's scoring a lot of goals and he's winning games.</p>\n<p>\"He's incredible and I think it's the best thing MLS have done to bring in Leo, in terms of marketing and in terms of football.\"</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Griezmann, 32, was one of LaLiga's best players last season, scoring 15 goals and providing a league-high 16 assists as Atletico Madrid finished third behind Barcelona and <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=478\">France</a> international said he still hopes to \"make history\" at Atletico but is clear about then wanting to try his luck in the U.S.</p>\n<p>\"I've always said it,\" Griezmann said. \"My target is to end up there, with everything that I like about American sports, playing in MLS and enjoying myself, being able to win things and be at my best level.</p>\n<p>\"First I want to make history here and win trophies at Atleti. After that we'll see... I think the arrival of Leo [Messi], 'Busi' [<a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio Busquets</a>] and Jordi [Alba] is good for the league. That and signing younger players, especially from South America, it's the best thing the league can do.\"</p>\n<p>Griezmann wouldn't rule out following the exodus of high-profile players to Saudi Arabia -- saying \"if it happened to me, I'd have to talk about it with my family and my kids... They're very high [salary] numbers, they can give you security\" -- but said he's now focused on challenging for the LaLiga title, a trophy he has yet to win, with Atletico.</p>\n<p>\"I want to improve, to score goals, to be important, to win the league and be there fighting for the Champions League,\" Griezmann said. \"You have all those targets, and for me personally it's about improving on last year, and scoring 16 or 17 goals which would make me the top scorer in the club's history. That's something which excites me.\"</p>\n<p>Griezmann said he empathized with teammate <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/276350/joao-felix\">João Félix</a>, who was whistled by Atletico's fans before their <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/674013\">3-1 win</a> over <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=3747\">Granada</a> on Monday after publicly stating that he would like to join Barcelona.</p>\n<p>\"I experienced it [when he left for Barca in 2019],\" he said. \"I hurt the club.

Trailing by a pair of goals in the 80th minute, Messi put in a free kick headed in for an FC Dallas own goal and then delivered one of his trademark direct free kicks into the top corner of FCD goalkeeper <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/238919/Maarten-Paes\">Maarten Paes</a>' net to tie the match 4-4 and send it into a penalty shootout.</p>\n<p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS\" target=\"_blank\">Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)</a></strong></p>\n<p>At the spot, Messi converted the first penalty, the first of five successful kicks for Inter Miami as the team won the shootout and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Leagues Cup.</p>\n<p>\"We have the best player in the world. That can't be ignored. When we have our moments, the team is lethal,\" Inter Miami manager Tata Martino said after the match. Yet, he also noted the team is \"still far from being a team you can trust.\"</p>\n<p><photo caption=\"Lionel Messi inspired Inter Miami to victory.\"></p>\n<p>Where would Inter Miami be without Messi? For Martino, it's not all that instructive of a thought exercise.</p>\n<p>\"This question always gets asked in the places where he is. Someone can bet on what <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> would've looked like without Messi, what the <a href=\"/soccer/team?id=202\">Argentina</a> national team would look like without Messi or anywhere he's been,\" Martino said. \"Fortunately, we have him, and today he once again showed he's a tremendously important player.</p>\n<p>\"The majority of times there's a free kick in this area, and I think only with him do you get the feeling that it's going to be a goal. A free kick usually is something where you think it won't be a goal 90% of the time, but when he has it, it's the opposite. You think it won't be a goal 10% of the time, but the rest it will be.\"</p>\n<p>Martino's counterpart Sunday, FC Dallas manager Nico Estévez, went one step further.</p>\n<p>\"It's obvious that for him a free kick around there is like a PK for another player. That's it,\" Estévez said. \"I think there's not much to say. Everyone can see it, and he's very consistent. You just have to pray the ball goes out of bounds or he falls in the run-up to kick the ball.\"</p>\n<p>While Messi made no stumbles and few errors Sunday night, the same can't be said of many of his Inter Miami teammates. FCD headed into the locker room with a 2-1 lead after goals from Facundo Quignon and <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/318373/Bernard-Kamungo\">Bernard Kamungo</a>.</p>\n<p>FCD extended that lead to 3-1 in the 63rd minute when Alan Velasco's free kick from the left wing bounced through traffic and into the Inter Miami net. And while Inter pulled back a goal shortly after, it again fell victim to its own sloppy play as forward <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/237823/Robert-Taylor\">Robert Taylor</a> put the ball into his own net in the 68th minute.</p>\n<p>\"When someone tries to design a team, there are a lot of things that make you think you're on the right path and can transform it into a great team,\" Martino said. \"Obviously in any great team, you can't lack character. I think we showed it today. We were full of errors, we weren't able to circulate the ball well, mostly in the first hour of the game, but the team also showed character, which gave us the chance to get through.\"</p>\n<p>It certainly wouldn't have happened without Messi and might not have happened without <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/356358/Benjamin-Cremaschi\">Benjamin Cremaschi</a>, an 18-year-old midfielder who scored a minute after coming on and also converted the fifth and final penalty kick.</p>\n<p>\"All the guys congratulated me and we all were happy we were able to come back and win on penalties,\" he said. \"It's a unique moment, a beautiful one for the club, but we know we've got to keep growing. There will be games that are going to be hard, but we know we can fight until the last minute.\"</p>\n<p>That was required Sunday night from a Miami team still coming together and still leaning on the best player in the world to get it out of any jam. For now, it's no problem. Messi has done just that, and Inter Miami is into the quarterfinal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
