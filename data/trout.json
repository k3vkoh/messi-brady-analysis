  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Baseball's winter meetings start Monday, and there's plenty of buzz surrounding this year's free agents, led by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, there's nothing quite like a blockbuster trade. Although these days you likely won't see a superstar traded for another superstar, there are a few big names who could switch cities for the right package of prospects. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a>, for one, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/38856371/juan-soto-trade-buzz-free-agency-san-diego-padres\">has been the talk of MLB executives</a> as being available this winter. Could the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> strike a deal with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a>? Or how about with ... the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>?</p>\n<p>Starting with Soto, ESPN MLB experts David Schoenfield and Kiley McDaniel run through some of the All-Star caliber players who would rock Nashville if they're traded next week. For each, they break down the teams that would make the most sense -- and would be the most fun -- as destinations, and what each of them might offer up in return.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sd.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The San Diego Padres should trade Juan Soto to the ...</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>Seattle Mariners</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>Or put it this way: Seattle should trade for Soto. The Mariners have seen their American League West rivals in Houston and Texas win the past two World Series, so the pressure is on to improve in a significant way, especially after seeing the Rangers leapfrog over them as the main competitors to the Astros. Seattle has the farm system to make a Soto trade with major league-ready talent, top 100 prospects like Harry Ford and Cole Young, and younger international players.</p>\n<p>Seattle's Jerry Dipoto and San Diego's A.J. Preller have been frequent trade partners, making this a possibility even if the Mariners wouldn't be considered the most likely destination. Note as well that the M's cleared payroll with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33377/teoscar-hernandez\">Teoscar Hernandez</a> in free agency and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a> trade.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>McDaniel: </strong>New York<strong> </strong>Yankees</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nyy.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>There are about a half dozen teams you could make a case for, but there's only really one that makes perfect sense. The Yankees are looking to make a splash to bounce back from a horrid 2023, and they have a lot of upper-minors prospects to entice San Diego. In addition to the Mariners, the Cubs, Rangers, Red Sox and Giants all make some sense, but it also wouldn't be surprising if none of those teams make serious offers. The Yankees almost certainly will, however. Both teams might accept a package like righty Chase Hampton (a top 100 prospect who will likely open 2024 in Triple-A), outfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41252/everson-pereira\">Everson Pereira</a> (a former top 100 prospect who debuted late in 2023) and infielder George Lombard Jr. (a 2023 first-round pick).</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nym.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> should trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37498/pete-alonso\">Pete Alonso</a> to the ...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chc.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>I'd like to see the Mets sign Alonso to an extension, considering his connection to the fans and his importance to the lineup -- he has averaged 44 home runs per season in his four full years, and sluggers like that aren't exactly easy to find. But I can also see why the Mets might be hesitant to give him a huge extension. He'll be 30 in his first post free agency year, and over the past three seasons, there have been just nine 4-WAR seasons from a first baseman 30 or older -- five of those by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30193/freddie-freeman\">Freddie Freeman</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31027/paul-goldschmidt\">Paul Goldschmidt</a>, who are better all-around hitters than Alonso. Alonso has had three 4-WAR seasons, but will they continue after he turns 30?</p>\n<p>If we're going to make a deal here, the Cubs are a good fit. They're looking to contend, they need a first baseman, they need to replace Cody Bellinger's production if he leaves, and they have one of the deepest farm systems in the game. The Mets can ask about reacquiring center fielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717833/pete-crow-armstrong\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, but that's not going to happen. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42927/christopher-morel\">Christopher Morel</a> is kind of a man without a position with the Cubs, so maybe the Mets could pry him away, or maybe they go for one of Chicago's pitching prospects.</p>\n<p><strong>McDaniel:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>There were deadline discussions between the Mets and Brewers about Alonso and now the former head of Milwaukee's baseball operations, David Stearns, is running things for the Mets. I'm leaning toward Dave's point that the Mets should hold onto him as one of the key pieces of their next winning club, but I could see how Stearns would say that paying retail on a nine-figure deal for a first baseman in his 30s isn't the direction he wants to go. The Brewers still make sense if they decide to keep their core together and go for it this year, but they might also deal <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39878/corbin-burnes\">Corbin Burnes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33675/willy-adames\">Willy Adames</a>. If the Brewers subtract and the Mets want to make a deal, then Baltimore makes the most sense. With the Orioles' wealth of young talent, a trade would be easy to put together -- something like outfielders Dylan Beavers or Jud Fabian as a headliner with a fringe 40-man guy or rookie-level lottery ticket thrown in.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> should trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> to the ...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a></p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>Well, I already wrote <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/38906521/mlb-phillies-angels-trade-mike-trout-2023-24\">why the Phillies should trade for Trout</a> -- although that was before the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33709/aaron-nola\">Aaron Nola</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/38833715/2023-24-mlb-offseason-grades-free-agency-trade-analysis\">signing</a>, so dealing for Trout now might push the payroll to uncomfortable levels. Plus, keep in mind that Trout has full no-trade protection, so that further limits the Angels' options. It's hard not to throw this out there, however: Yankees outfielders hit just .220/.293/.399 in 2023 (26th in the majors in OPS) -- and that was with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>. They want left-handed hitting help, but would they turn down Trout if the Angels are willing to trade him?</p>\n<p><strong>McDaniel:</strong> Philadelphia Phillies</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>The Phillies are the only team that really makes sense. Some big-market clubs could use a big-money star, but only the Phillies are among those who would do something like this while also having the lure for Trout of being a homecoming. The deal would be complicated, with one or more bad contracts going the other way, like the trades that sent <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31261/nolan-arenado\">Nolan Arenado</a> to the Cardinals or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30583/giancarlo-stanton\">Giancarlo Stanton</a> to the Yankees. The Rangers are the other team you could make an argument for, but I'm not sure they want to make that bold of a move when things are going this well. Trout is exactly the sort of player Yankees GM Brian Cashman seems to be trying to steer away from (older, injury prone, big contract), but they are another semi-homecoming candidate.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nyy.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The New York Yankees should trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33804/gleyber-torres\">Gleyber Torres</a> to the ...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>The thinking here is that Torres is in his final season before free agency, scheduled to make an estimated $15 million, and is coming off two pretty good seasons after a downturn in 2020-21. The Yankees have other options for second base and might want to clear his salary to create more space for a Soto trade or Bellinger signing or whatever big move(s) they make. This is a hard fit because Torres' projected salary is higher than small-market teams will want to go and most contenders are set at second. The one team that needs a second baseman: the Red Sox. Yeah, good luck making a trade there. So maybe the Pirates? Second-worst WAR at second base in 2023 and their payroll is so low they could absorb Torres' salary.</p>\n<p><strong>McDaniel:</strong> Seattle Mariners</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>There are a lot of options here because most teams can afford a $15 million salary, have the prospects to acquire Torres, and would be fine with the one-year term before he hits free agency. Seattle just traded Suarez and is in go-for-it mode with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35383/luis-urias\">Luis Urias</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40718/josh-rojas\">Josh Rojas</a> starting at third and second base. Once free agent third baseman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman\">Matt Chapman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32531/jeimer-candelario\">Jeimer Candelario</a> come off the board, it's just role players and bounce-back types left, so the market for Torres should heat up. I'd think Seattle is at the front of that line if it doesn't sign either of those free agents, and trading righty <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4297897/emerson-hancock\">Emerson Hancock</a> should get the deal done.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tb.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a> should trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33190/tyler-glasnow\">Tyler Glasnow</a> to the ...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>Chicago Cubs</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chc.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>So now I've added Alonso <em>and</em> Glasnow -- but the Cubs have the farm system to make both trades and the payroll space to add Glasnow's $25 million salary. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32815/marcus-stroman\">Marcus Stroman</a> is a free agent, so the Cubs do need another front-of-the-rotation starter to join <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41022/justin-steele\">Justin Steele</a>. Glasnow should be ready to go 180-plus innings in his second season back from Tommy John surgery (although we should note his career high was 2023's 120 innings).</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><strong>McDaniel:</strong> San Diego Padres</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sd.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>Glasnow is a particular kind of pitcher, with hellacious stuff and enough command to be effective. The Rays do well developing this kind of pitcher and the Padres clearly like trading for them, with an opening as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33748/blake-snell\">Blake Snell</a> is likely to leave San Diego. The Dodgers -- who have some Rays DNA with president Andrew Friedman -- also like this sort of pitcher, need more starters for 2024 and don't have a giant long-term need given their system depth and currently injured options, so Glasnow fits them particularly well, too.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cws.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a> should trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34943/dylan-cease\">Dylan Cease</a> to the ...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>The Orioles have to be in on one of these starting pitchers. I don't think GM Mike Elias' strategy is to spend nine figures on a risky free agent like Snell or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38173/jordan-montgomery\">Jordan Montgomery</a>, as he would prefer to trade from his farm system depth and take a starter like Cease, who has two seasons until free agency. The Orioles are loaded with infielders and the White Sox are desperate for infield help. Actually, the White Sox are desperate for just about anything. If they're focusing on pitching as the primary return for Cease, there might be a better match, but the Orioles have a deep list of position players.</p>\n<p><strong>McDaniel:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/atl.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>The Braves have been clearing roster spots and payroll space for a big move that many first thought would be signing Nola. Then there was buzz they could add <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32082/sonny-gray\">Sonny Gray</a> -- who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/38833715/2023-24-mlb-offseason-grades-free-agency-trade-analysis\">just signed with the Cardinals</a> -- but now it could be Cease, who's from Georgia. I don't think GM Alex Anthopoulos wants to add a rental pitcher, so Cease also fits the Braves' needs with two years of control. That said, their farm system has just barely enough to make that deal -- it might take three of the top five prospects to get in striking distance -- so it would be close to an all-in deal for Atlanta. The Orioles also fit, as Dave said, and a deal would be much easier, as would one with San Diego.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Milwaukee Brewers should trade Corbin Burnes to the ...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/lad.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>We have to get the Dodgers in here somewhere, right?

Even if they sign Shohei Ohtani, he's not pitching in 2024. So there's a little sense of desperation here, and if the Brewers do decide to trade Burnes, the Dodgers aren't hanging up the phone, not when it comes to acquiring a potential No. 1 starter.</p>\n<p>The Brewers can ask about a slew of major-league-ready starters like Emmett Sheehan, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4208281/ryan-pepiot\">Ryan Pepiot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4417230/gavin-stone\">Gavin Stone</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4425127/nick-frasso\">Nick Frasso</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4417826/landon-knack\">Landon Knack</a> and River Ryan, who aren't far away. Infielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4722676/jorbit-vivas\">Jorbit Vivas</a> had a .381 OBP at Double-A. Outfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42468/andy-pages\">Andy Pages</a> has a big upside if he can cut down on the strikeouts. Heck, maybe this trade is expanded to include Willy Adames, with the Dodgers getting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40423/gavin-lux\">Gavin Lux</a> back at second base as he returns from injury.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p><strong>McDaniel</strong>: Baltimore Orioles</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p>There are some similarities in style and repertoire between Burnes and pitchers the O's have selected and developed. Since they'd basically be trading for Burnes on a one-year, roughly $15 million deal, that would limit the prospect price and eliminate the long-term commitment spanning non-prime years that Baltimore would have to be OK with.

His trade value isn't anywhere close to where it was even last offseason. And while the Guardians have all those rookie starters who impressed in 2023 -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4345278/tanner-bibee\">Tanner Bibee</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4345076/gavin-williams\">Gavin Williams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4683350/logan-allen\">Logan Allen</a> -- they already traded <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39875/cal-quantrill\">Cal Quantrill</a>, so they've cut into their depth. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34954/triston-mckenzie\">Triston McKenzie</a> is coming off shoulder problems that limited him to four starts.

His value is down enough at the moment that the return wouldn't be huge, and Cleveland would be among the top teams I'd bet on to right the ship and rebuild his value anyway. There's a real shot he bounces back and headlines a playoff rotation, but if things don't work out that way, I can see a fit with the Mets. They need to add innings and Stearns will be focused on avoiding big long-term deals or trading top prospects, instead looking for upside that can be teased out via development.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Long before the start of the first game of the National League Championship Series, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> managing partner John Middleton could be found wandering the media dining room at Citizens Bank Park. When asked what an owner does four hours before a playoff game, he said: \"Pace.\"</p>\n<p>And after his team won the first two games only to shockingly blow the series lead and lose in seven games to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, you have to imagine there has been a lot of pacing in the Phillies' front office since then.</p>\n<p>An offense that had dominated the beginning of the postseason with seven wins in eight games suddenly went cold, hitting .197 over the final five games and scoring just three runs in the final two defeats at home.</p>\n<p>It was a disappointing ending to a successful season. After all, the club has now reached the World Series and the NLCS in back-to-back seasons, falling short of a championship both times. Getting that close only increases the desire to win it all -- especially for an owner like Middleton, who has shown the willingness to spend money, and an executive like Dave Dombrowski, who is always in win-now mode.</p>\n<p>The Phillies just haven't been quite good enough. Even though they defeated the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a> in each of the past two playoffs, they also finished 14 games behind their division rivals both seasons. They need to get better in the regular season <em>and</em> a little better in the postseason.</p>\n<p>And here's a wild idea on how to do that: Trade for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>. Bring him home.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Would the Angels even trade Trout? Would the Phillies trade <em>for</em> him?</h2>\n\n\n<p>It's admittedly a far-fetched idea. For starters, during last week's general managers meetings, all indications from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> GM Perry Minasian were that Trout won't be traded.</p>\n<p>\"Mike Trout's an Angel,\" Minasian told MLB Network. \"We're excited to have Mike Trout. He's, if not the best, one of the best hitters to ever play the game and he's somebody that we love to be associated with. I go back to it again: Somebody who is going to help us win a lot of games.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Of course, there were reports late in the season that the Angels would be open to trading Trout if he asked out of L.A., which led him to say: \"These conversations happen every year, not just this year. ... The plan, as it always is, is to take a couple weeks off in the offseason, clear my mind, get in shape, get ready to play and go from there.\"</p>\n<p>Neither of those statements are exactly 100% firm denials, though. And if <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> signs with a new team in free agency in the coming months -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/38841002/shohei-ohtani-free-agent-latest-news-updates-analysis\">the likely scenario</a> -- the whole landscape changes for the Angels.</p>\n<p>On the Phillies' side of things, all indications point to a focus on pitching in the offseason. At his end-of-season news conference, Dombrowski said the team's top priority was to re-sign free agent pitcher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33709/aaron-nola\">Aaron Nola</a> -- or acquire a comparable pitcher. \"We love him,\" Dombrowski said. \"He's been tremendous for the franchise. He's pitched very well for a number of years. He's a Phillie. We hope to retain him, but if we don't, to me that would be our No. 1 area. We'd need then to replace him.\"</p>\n<p>There has also been speculation, however, that the Phillies would be open to trading right fielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31187/nick-castellanos\">Nick Castellanos</a>, who has three years and $60 million left on his contract. Dombrowski has also said that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42829/johan-rojas\">Johan Rojas</a>, the team's center fielder throughout the playoffs, hasn't necessarily earned that spot for 2024 after hitting .093 in October. While he hit .302 in 149 at-bats in the regular season and his defense was spectacular, Rojas also had a poor 42-to-5 strikeout-to-walk ratio.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not going to anoint him a position with our big league club next year,\" Dombrowski said. \"He has to be able to contribute some offense or he has to go down and continue to develop.\"</p>\n<p>And there's the opening we need to speculate about a Trout trade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40803/brandon-marsh\">Brandon Marsh</a> could slide back to center field, opening left field for Trout, who probably should move there at this point in his career anyway. Or the Phillies could trade Castellanos, move Marsh to right and live with Rojas and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39897/cristian-pache\">Cristian Pache</a> in center. Either way, the outfield isn't exactly locked down.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Why Trout makes so much sense for the Phillies</h2>\n\n\n<p>The Phillies' offense is, dare we say, a little overrated. I mean, did you watch the final two games of the NLCS? Or the final three games of the World Series in 2022, when Philly scored just three runs and got no-hit by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> in Game 4? While the Phillies were fourth in the NL and eighth in the majors in runs scored in 2023, remember that they play in a hitter-friendly park. They were just 14th in the majors in runs scored on the road.</p>\n<p>It's a good offense, but it hasn't been a great offense -- at least, not consistently. There's no denying the Phillies can get hot. For the first two-and-a-half rounds of the playoffs -- before everything went downhill in Phoenix -- they were unstoppable, scoring 46 runs and hitting 19 home runs in their first eight playoff games. In fact, the long ball was what propelled the Phillies, as they hit 11 against the Braves in the NLDS and six in the first two games against the D-backs.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>They perhaps became <em>too</em> homer-centric -- despite Dombrowski's emphasis that their philosophy is not to \"just hit the ball out of the park\" -- as a decline in home runs coincided with an inability to get on base, resulting in their ultimate demise.</p>\n<p>\"We got into a home-run-hitting frenzy,\" Dombrowski said. \"We were popping the ball out of the park all the time. Normally, if you're just trying to hit the ball out of the ballpark, you're going to struggle at times, so we don't preach that, but at the end of the season, that's where we were living and dying. ... We just didn't get guys on base in the majority of those five games.\"</p>\n<p><em>Get guys on base.</em></p>\n<p>That leads us back to Trout again, because what does he do best? Get on base. Even last year, when he had his worst season, his .367 on-base percentage would have ranked third on the Phillies behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30951/bryce-harper\">Bryce Harper</a> and Marsh. The only other regular above .330 was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33712/kyle-schwarber\">Kyle Schwarber</a>. Among players with at least 1,000 plate appearances over the past three seasons, Trout ranks eighth in OBP (and third in OPS, behind only <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> and Ohtani).</p>\n<p>\"We swung at way too many pitches out of the strike zone this year,\" Dombrowski said. \"Way too many. And I know we have guys that chase, but for whatever reason they chased even more this year, and that's something I think we need to address. I know we'll address because we've already had meetings in that regard.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Phillies had a 30.9% chase rate -- 26th out of 30 teams. (The World Series champion <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a> had the second-lowest chase rate in the majors.) The Phillies actually weren't much better in this area in 2022, ranking 26th at 30.7%. Over the two seasons, they are ninth overall in OBP but just 18th in walk rate and 18th in strikeout rate.</p>\n<p>Castellanos is the ringleader in this department, as he had a chase rate of 40.9%, among the worst in the majors. He finished with 185 strikeouts and just 36 walks, so while he ended up with nice counting totals of 29 home runs and 106 RBIs, throw in his subpar defense and he was worth just 1.5 WAR. That, paired with his streaky tendencies in the past two postseasons, play into the speculation that the Phillies could trade him, opening up an avenue to acquire Trout.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Is Trout still a game-changer?</h2>\n\n\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Of course, the big question here is: What kind of player is Trout right now, entering his age-32 season? Would any team really risk taking on his contract given that he has averaged just 79 games played the past three seasons?</p>\n<p>Let's lay out the basics:</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>He's owed about $248 million for seven more seasons ($35.45 million per year), so the contract covers his age 32-38 seasons.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>He <em>is</em> coming off his worst season: .858 OPS, 131 OPS+, career-high 28.7% strikeout rate in 82 games played, including just one after July 3 because of a fractured hamate bone and lingering pain.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>The strikeout rate is the concerning issue. From 2016 to 2019, he never struck out more than 20.4% of the time. It has now hovered around 28% three seasons in a row, so this is who he is -- a hitter who strikes out about 6% more often than the average hitter.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>He still draws walks and hits for power. He's just one season removed from mashing 40 home runs in 119 games and finishing eighth in the MVP voting.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>His defensive metrics have been average to above average in center field. He's not Rojas or Marsh but would likely rank as a big plus in left field. While the Phillies would like to keep Schwarber in the DH role as much as possible, they could certainly move him to left on occasion to give Trout's legs a day off.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>The Phillies' payroll is at an estimated $210 million to $215 million (about $230 million for tax purposes), and that's without re-signing or replacing Nola. In 2023, it ended up around an estimated $246 million (pre-tax).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My take: Trout is still one of the best hitters in the game. Even with his subpar (for him) numbers from 2023, his 134 wRC+ (weighted runs created) would make him one of the 15 to 20 best hitters in the game. It's also hard not to believe that a trade would reenergize Trout a little bit. Playing for a World Series contender rather than an also-ran should get the blood flowing a little more for a veteran player who has made the playoffs just once in his 13-year career. At 32, maybe his best days are behind him, but there are still plenty of good seasons left in his bat -- including maybe a couple more in which he's still one of best three or four hitters in the sport.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>There's also the fact that some of his injuries have been unique injuries -- or at least they've been to different parts of his body: a torn calf muscle in 2021, a month missed in 2022 because of a troublesome back issue (from which he returned and hit .321 with 12 home runs in September) and then the broken hand in 2023.</p>\n<p>Just imagine Trout in the cozy confines of Citizens Bank Park. Dombrowski has gone after star players in the past -- and it's hard to get a bigger one than Mike Trout.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>What trade(s) would work for both sides?</h2>\n\n\n<p>So, what might a potential deal look like? The Phillies won't want to take on all of Trout's salary and give something back of value, so let's find a middle ground: Castellanos, outfield prospect Justin Crawford, pitching prospect Griff McGarry and $5 million in cash each year from 2024 to 2026 (basically turning Castellanos' salary into $15 million per season).</p>\n<p>The key for the Phillies is that \"win now\" proposition. They need to do whatever they can to win in the next couple of years. Sure, Trout comes with injury risk -- but also enormous upside. He was worth 6.3 WAR in 2022. They could bat him in front of Harper or behind Harper. Think of the state of their roster: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31267/zack-wheeler\">Zack Wheeler</a> is a free agent after 2024 and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32177/jt-realmuto\">J.T. Realmuto</a> and Schwarber after 2025, not to mention that Harper and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> will be 31 next year. The Phillies have to put all their chips on the table right now -- and Dombrowski certainly knows how to do that.</p>\n<p>For 2024 through 2026, we've added $35 million in salary for Trout while subtracting $15 million, a net gain of $20 million. That still leaves room to sign a starting pitcher -- maybe not Nola, but the reality of that situation is that once a player reaches free agency he rarely goes back to the same team. The Phillies could look to make a trade for somebody on a one-year deal like Milwaukee's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39878/corbin-burnes\">Corbin Burnes</a> or Tampa Bay's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33190/tyler-glasnow\">Tyler Glasnow</a>, or sign a free agent starter like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32082/sonny-gray\">Sonny Gray</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32815/marcus-stroman\">Marcus Stroman</a> who would fit Dombrowski's desire for quality while also costing less than Nola (and perhaps providing just as much value given Nola's 4.46 ERA in 2023).</p>\n<p>As for the Angels, maybe that return feels light for one of the greatest players of all time. The simple truth is that Trout's contract, age and injury history will limit the return. But they do get some value. Castellanos gives them a DH or right fielder to replace Ohtani or Hunter Renfroe. The speedy Crawford hit .332 with 47 stolen bases between Single-A and High-A this season. McGarry is a tough-to-hit starter with control problems (and could end up a reliever as a result). Maybe the Angels would prefer Rojas to Crawford, but Crawford has more upside.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Most importantly, the Angels clear Trout's salary for the long term -- and admit that a rebuild is really their only path to future success.</p>\n<p>They haven't won <em>with</em> Trout and Ohtani, so it seems unlikely they're going to win without Ohtani, not in a division with the Rangers, Astros and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>. They could look at shortstop <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4666100/zach-neto\">Zach Neto</a>, catcher Logan O'Hoppe and first baseman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4739755/nolan-schanuel\">Nolan Schanuel</a> and see the hopes for a foundation for the future. Without Ohtani and Trout, they've cleared $67 million off the 2023 payroll (they're stuck with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a> at $38.5 million for four more years). They could spend those savings in the 2024-25 offseason, which will see a much better free agent class (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37498/pete-alonso\">Pete Alonso</a>, Wheeler, Burnes, Glasnow, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32685/max-fried\">Max Fried</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34886/alex-bregman\">Alex Bregman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31662/jose-altuve\">Jose Altuve</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39251/walker-buehler\">Walker Buehler</a>).</p>\n<p>Again ... all of this is unlikely. Arte Moreno probably doesn't want to go down as the owner who lost both Ohtani and Trout, but the Angels also haven't finished with a winning record since 2015. And Middleton doesn't want to see his Phillies break down in late October for a third straight season.</p>\n<p>It's time to make some changes -- for both teams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, typically as composed as anybody in his profession, was visibly emotional while talking about his recent string of injuries Monday, one day after <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> manager Phil Nevin declared that Trout would not return from his recent hand injury in time to play again this season.</p>\n<p>Trout, on a trajectory to being one of the greatest players in baseball history as recently as 2020, has played in fewer than half of the Angels' games over the past three years.</p>\n<p>His tally this year will be 82.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it's frustrating,\" Trout said, visibly shaken. \"I wanted to get back. It's tough. It's been hard.\"</p>\n<p>Trout, 32, won three American League MVP awards within his first eight full seasons and finished as the runner-up in four other instances. But a torn calf muscle kept him off the field beyond the middle of May in 2021. In 2022, he missed a little more than a month around midseason because of a troublesome back issue. His goal entering 2023 was simply to remain healthy.</p>\n<p>\"I hired a ton of people to work on my body,\" Trout said. \"My body felt great. A freak thing happened and I broke my hand.\"</p>\n<p>Trout suffered a fracture to the hamate bone on the bottom part of his left hand while completing a swing in San Diego on July 3. He pushed to come back seven weeks later, on Aug. 22, with the Angels still on the fringes of contention, but his hand didn't respond favorably. He played in one game before returning to the injured list and will not be activated again, his season ending with a .263/.367/.490 slash line and 18 home runs.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"When I came back, I was in pain,\" Trout said. \"My swing wasn't right. Just wasn't myself. I was taking it day-to-day, trying for the soreness and just the discomfort to go away. It never did. Now, giving it a few extra days off, it's going away. I'm starting my swing process. I've been swinging. I'm not going to come back, but I wanted to. I just wanted to get my head straight for the offseason, clear my mind. Just have a healthy offseason.\"</p>\n<p>This offseason will come with more questions than ever for Trout and the Angels. Trout has seven years and nearly $250 million remaining on the mega-extension he signed heading into the 2019 season, and there are questions throughout the industry about whether he and the Angels might actually part ways.</p>\n<p>Trout's age and recent injury history -- not to mention the fact that he has the right to block any trade -- would make it exceedingly difficult to move his contract. But former teammates have wondered recently if Trout has reached a tipping point and might ask Angels owner Arte Moreno, team president John Carpino and general manager Perry Minasian to work out a trade this offseason. Trout gave no indications that was the case while addressing the media Monday, but he also didn't necessarily dispel the notion.</p>\n<p>He is expected to meet with the front office to talk about the team's direction in the near future.</p>\n<p>\"These conversations happen every year, not just this year,\" Trout said. \"They're private conversations I have with the front office -- John and Perry, all those guys up there. So just keep it as that. The plan, as it always is, is to take a couple weeks off in the offseason, clear my mind, get in shape, get ready to play and go from there.\"</p>\n<p>Trout provided a similar answer when asked if he wants to see it through with the Angels, saying: \"I go through this every year. That's private conversations I have with Arte and John, and I'm doing the same thing I did last, what, 13 years, just go into the offseason, clear my mind, get ready for spring and, you know, wearing an Angels uniform in spring.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels began the final week of the regular season with a 70-86 record, having already clinched their eighth consecutive losing season to set a franchise record.</p>\n<p>The Angels went on a run early in the second half to vault back into contention, at which point the front office decided not to trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832\">Shohei Ohtani</a> and instead augment an ailing roster by dealing away prospects from a relatively thin farm system. The Angels then went 8-19 during a nightmarish August, a month that saw Ohtani suffer a torn ulnar collateral ligament that prematurely ended his season as a pitcher. Ohtani, whose season as a hitter ended with an oblique injury, will soon enter free agency and is widely expected to sign elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\"People ask me this all the time, 'Where's Shohei going to go?' Couldn't tell you. It's up to him,\" Trout said. \"You got to ask him. Ultimately it comes down to his decision. He hasn't said anything to me. He keeps it quiet, just does his own stuff. As another teammate, I think just give him his privacy. It's his decision. He's going to do what's right for him. We'll see how that goes.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels are expected to do everything possible to re-sign Ohtani. But they're burdened by their commitment with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a>, who has played in just 148 games over the past three years and is owed another $114 million over the next three.

Unfortunately, Ohtani's injury and his plan to seek a second opinion before deciding exactly how to address it has a bearing on his role as a hitter, too.

The Dodgers, whose pitching staff will be taxed by Thursday's resumption of Wednesday's suspended game (not to mention that they've just lost <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38958/tony-gonsolin\">Tony Gonsolin</a>, probably for the season) have an additional rotation spot to fill beyond simply Thursday call-up <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4208281/ryan-pepiot\">Ryan Pepiot</a>. I'll be watching Pepiot's performance closely. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a> pushed back <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4917854/eury-perez\">Eury Perez</a></strong> by a day to Saturday, presumably to keep his workload in check.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a> are considering a six-man rotation with <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42450/joe-ryan\">Joe Ryan</a></strong> returning on Saturday, and he's a pitcher I very much will be tracking for fantasy purposes. <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33190/tyler-glasnow\">Tyler Glasnow</a></strong> was pushed back to Saturday by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a>, which concerns me based on his injury struggles all month. And speaking of those six-man rotations, by my count, we've currently got seven of the 30 teams utilizing them (assuming the Twins join the fray), with a handful more headed in that direction.</p>\n<p>Pitching matchups homework is never an easy task by the time our head-to-head playoffs arrive!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/columnists/karabell_eric_m.jpg\" transparent=\"true\" width=\"50\"> <b>Karabell: </b>It is indeed getting tougher to find clarity on which pitchers are pitching which days, and by this part of the season, I just go day to day and rely on healthy, reliable pitchers and hope they have positive matchups. You know, Tristan, we are all day-to-day anyway. By the way, I think Giants manager Gabe Kapler brought in another relief pitcher while I was typing this.</p>\n<p>Lean on your best pitchers in fantasy and, by the way, be careful when streaming on weekends in your weekly leagues. We focus so much on upside than we often forget about the downside. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a> RHP <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39635/hunter-greene\">Hunter Greene</a></strong>, for example, cost many a fantasy manager their weekly matchup with his homer-laden return to the mound.

It was 82 games. That's all we got from Trout in 2023. We don't do pointless victory laps around here, but my placing Trout on the annual \"Do Not Draft\" list continues to be a safe, though sad, bet. It may be a bit early for this angle, but other high-profile teams may start shutting down big-name veterans, too. The Mets and Cardinals are both done. The White Sox are done. What if <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a></strong> feels a toe tweak this weekend?</p>\n<p>I hope September baseball doesn't become the equivalent to football's Week 18, with tons of star players sitting on the bench.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/columnists/cockcroft_tristan_m.jpg\" transparent=\"true\" width=\"50\"> <b>Cockcroft: </b>Hmmm, come to think of it, I've had this nagging soreness in my left ankle, probably from sitting on it awkwardly while TV binging.

The opposing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> face three righty starters in that series at Chase Field, and they're getting great production of late from right-handed <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42464/gabriel-moreno\">Gabriel Moreno</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31208/tommy-pham\">Tommy Pham</a></strong>.

It should be interesting to see if they continue hitting. The Astros may start <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717803/hunter-brown\">Hunter Brown</a></strong> on Saturday, but he has looked dreadful lately. We all liked Brown entering the season, but his struggles are a reminder that young pitching is often anything but reliable.

Basabe could become a fantasy fixture soon. Also, keep an eye on Rays OF <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36488/randy-arozarena\">Randy Arozarena</a></strong>. Yes, he's been awful since the All-Star break, but he has homered twice this week. Perhaps he is fine now!</p>\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> has a tear in the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and will not pitch again this season, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> general manager Perry Minasian said Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, a shocking twist in the lead-up to arguably the most highly anticipated free agency in baseball history.</p>\n<p>Ohtani exited his start in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a> earlier Wednesday after recording just four outs and throwing only 26 pitches. A subsequent MRI revealed the tear, though Minasian said he did not know the severity of it. Ohtani nonetheless insisted on serving as the designated hitter in Game 2, ultimately going 1-for-5 in the Angels' 7-3 loss, and will seek secondary opinions to determine his next step.</p>\n<p>One option, of course, is Tommy John surgery, a procedure he already underwent on his right elbow in October 2018 and one that would keep him off the mound for the entirety of the 2024 season -- a development that would significantly affect a free agent sweepstakes that many expected to yield a $500-plus million contract.</p>\n<p>\"As far as plans and details, I don't have those yet,\" Minasian said at Angel Stadium. \"I've been in contact with his representation. Obviously he hit the second game. He's played with this, in '18, but with that being said we'll take it day by day and see where it goes. Obviously disappointing news. I feel terrible for him. But it is what it is. If anybody can bounce back, it's him.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The Angels recently opted not to trade Ohtani, the two-way sensation they hoped to sign to a lucrative extension, and have gone 5-16 since the Aug. 1 trade deadline, on pace for a franchise-record eighth consecutive losing season. They currently are riding a four-game losing streak. And their other superstar, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, who returned from a seven-week absence because of a hamate fracture earlier this week, will return to the injured list because his attempts to swing in Tuesday's game \"didn't go well,\" Minasian said.</p>\n<p>The Angels can at least hold out hope that Trout will return this season.</p>\n<p>Ohtani -- at least the pitcher -- will not.</p>\n<p>Ohtani previously battled a cracked nail and a blister on his right middle finger. Often in recent weeks, he also has navigated through cramping issues. And he asked to skip his previous start because of what Angels manager Phil Nevin described as \"arm fatigue.\" It's the same term the Angels initially used to describe the reason for Ohtani's early exit Wednesday, his first start in 14 days. His fastball was down to an average of 93.1 mph, nearly four ticks slower than his season average.</p>\n<p>Minasian said the Angels were not aware of any issues before Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\"He never complained about anything,\" Minasian added about Ohtani, who was not made available to reporters. \"He had cramps, he was dehydrated, but today is the day. He came out of the game and said, 'Hey, I've got pain in the elbow area.' It's the first day we've heard of any type of pain.\"</p>\n<p>Ohtani, 29, was diagnosed with a Grade 2 sprain of his UCL in June of his rookie season in 2018 and hoped to combat the need for Tommy John surgery with platelet-rich plasma and stem-cell therapy. He remained in the lineup throughout that process, then was told he needed Tommy John surgery on Sept. 5 -- and he hit two home runs later that night. Ohtani put off the procedure until the early part of the offseason, spent all of 2019 rehabbing as a pitcher -- while serving as a full-time DH -- and struggled in both aspects during the COVID-19-shortened season in 2020.</p>\n<p>His prowess as a two-way phenomenon began in 2021, a year that saw him win the American League's Most Valuable Player Award unanimously. He would have won the hardware again in 2022 if not for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>'s record-setting home run campaign. And in 2023, he looks like the easy favorite again -- even with the Angels once again out of the playoff picture, and even with another UCL tear ruling him out as a pitcher for the final six weeks.</p>\n<p>Ohtani, who hit his major league-leading 44th home run moments before exiting his start, is slashing .304/.405/.664 this season but also boasts a 3.14 ERA with 167 strikeouts in 132 innings. His 8.7 FanGraphs wins above replacement easily leads the majors.</p>\n<p>The Angels, who are off Thursday, still don't know whether Ohtani will hit the rest of this season.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to go day to day and just see how it goes, see how he feels,\" Minasian said. \"I think as we get more information, as far as recovery time and all those types of things, we'll have more information down the road.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Three-time AL MVP <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> returned to the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>' lineup Tuesday night after missing 38 games with a broken bone in his left hand.</p>\n<p>The Angels activated Trout before they hosted the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a>, and he took his usual No. 2 spot in the order while playing center field. He went 1-for-4, legging out an infield single in the eighth inning for his only hit, and the Angels fell 4-3.</p>\n<p>Trout hadn't played since July 3, when he broke the hamate bone by fouling off a pitch in the eighth inning in San Diego. The 32-year-old superstar had surgery to repair the break, but he was back in the lineup seven weeks after the injury.</p>\n<p>Trout returned even while his healing hand still gets unusually painful when he hits in the batting cage. With the Angels' playoff hopes hanging by a thread, Trout decided he couldn't wait any longer. </p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"It's definitely sore, but I've talked to some doctors and they've told me it can't get injured more,\" Trout said. \"There's definitely going to be soreness up there, but I'm just happy to be out there with the guys.\"</p>\n<p>The Halos (61-65) went 16-22 in Trout's absence, including 11 losses in their last 18 games to fall to the fringe of the AL playoff race despite another stellar season from AL MVP frontrunner <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> and the acquisition of several veterans at the trade deadline. Friday's loss put the Angels 10 games back of the final wild-card spot.</p>\n<p>\"We're not out of it,\" Trout said. \"I've seen some crazy stuff. We've got a group of guys in there that just won't stop fighting. ... Obviously, this isn't where we wanted to be right now, but we're not coming in and just giving up.\"</p>\n<p>Trout has never won a playoff game, and he has appeared in only three postseason contests, all back in 2014. His Angels currently have the majors' longest active streaks of losing seasons (seven) and non-playoff seasons (eight, tied with Detroit).</p>\n<p>That's more than enough motivation for Trout to hit through some pain for the remainder of the regular season, he said.</p>\n<p>\"We're running out of time here, so I'm expecting to try to be in there every day,\" Trout said.</p>\n<p>Trout is batting .263 with 18 homers, 44 RBIs and a .857 OPS this season, his third consecutive campaign in which he has missed several weeks of playing time due to injury. He was still named the AL All-Star team for the 11th consecutive season, not counting 2020, despite currently having his lowest OPS since his rookie season in 2011.</p>\n<p>\"Writing his name down [in the lineup], there's excitement there,\" Angels manager Phil Nevin said. \"I just think there's a different buzz in the room. There's a lot of guys that are here, some guys that we traded for, that haven't had a chance to play with him yet. He's been a teammate in the dugout helping everybody out. So getting him back on the field and seeing that is a huge lift-up for everybody.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels' game on Tuesday night was their first since Saturday after two straight games were moved due to Tropical Storm Hilary and its aftereffects.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- It's Aug. 7, the day of his 32nd birthday, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> finds himself in a race against time.</p>\n<p>He wears a backward cap and a red <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> tank top and sprints along the basepaths at 2 o'clock on a bright, sweltering Monday afternoon, doing his best to simulate game action on an otherwise empty field. Trout has spent the better part of a month doing everything possible to beat the six-to-eight-week timetable that has become a standard-bearer for hamate fractures, pushing the limits of his rehab in hopes of returning before an entire season -- another one -- slips away. Playing in pain is inevitable.</p>\n<p>\"I know I'm gonna be hurtin',\" he says after a quick break, beads of sweat dripping off his forehead. \"But once it's tolerable, I'm gonna go out there.\"</p>\n<p>There is a palpable sense of urgency that surrounds the Angels this year, perhaps unlike any other before it. As if time is running out. As if what's next is too unnerving to confront. As if an ominous tipping point has been reached.</p>\n<p>It's hard not to consider Arte Moreno's place in all of it. The latter half of his two-decade-plus reign as the Angels' owner has been marked by impulsive decisions that, when coupled with bad drafts and poor acquisitions by his general managers, compromised sustainability and helped squander the prime years of two of baseball's defining figures, according to more than a dozen people employed by him in various capacities during that stretch. His competitiveness has been admired, but many believe it has also hindered. And his actions over the past 12 months -- a period in which he invested in the present more heavily than ever before, all while entertaining the sale of his franchise and the potential trade of its most valuable asset -- have only raised the stakes.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>In hopes of capitalizing on what could be their final season with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and persuading him to stay in the process, Moreno's Angels put everything they have into 2023. They vaulted their payroll to new heights, promoted their best prospects aggressively, shed what little they had from a thin farm system in order to augment an ailing roster -- and then they watched it unravel too quickly.</p>\n<p>The decision not to trade Ohtani before the Aug. 1 deadline has been followed by 13 losses in a stretch of 18 games, including a seven-game losing streak, dropping the Angels' playoff odds below 1%. Barring a late-season resurgence that would go down as one of the greatest in at least half a century, the Angels -- now 61-64 and nine games out of the final wild-card spot -- are poised for their 13th playoff absence in 14 years, an unfathomable predicament considering the transcendent talents they've employed in that stretch.</p>\n<p>In the words of one longtime staffer: \"It's been a decade of disaster.\"</p>\n<p>And the next phase is appreciably murky. The manager is on an expiring contract, the general manager's status feels unsettled and nobody seems to know how long Moreno will remain in charge. The forthcoming free agency of a transcendent, unprecedented two-way star -- one who provided no insight toward his leanings in multiple media availabilities before and after the trade deadline -- hangs over all of it.</p>\n<p>As another season nears its conclusion, Moreno and his Angels find themselves in what feels like an exceedingly vulnerable predicament -- bring Ohtani back, or fade into irrelevance.</p>\n<p>\"There's a lot of questions,\" Trout said. \"The whole Shohei situation -- I don't think anybody knows what he's feeling or what he's thinking. It's ultimately gonna come down to what he thinks and what he feels, and he's gonna do what's right for him and what he feels is right. I see him on a daily basis, obviously. He's coming in every day. He looks like he's enjoying it and feels comfortable. But I don't know. It's gonna be a tough go this winter. You never know what's gonna happen. There's gonna be a lot of teams out there wanting him. Who wouldn't?</p>\n<p>\"But you can't predict what's gonna happen in the future. You just gotta look at what's in front of you.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p><strong>\"NOW IS THE TIME,\"</strong> read part of Moreno's statement announcing that he was exploring a sale of the Angels on Aug. 23, 2022. As the process went along, a record price became a near-certainty. Potential buyers were told not to proceed if they weren't prepared to pay at least $2.5 billion, slightly more than what Steve Cohen bought the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> for in 2020. Five bidders were ready to pay at least that much, including investors from Japan, said sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>\n<p>On the morning of Jan. 23, a little more than two weeks before bids were due, they were each told the team was off the market, a shocking twist in a five-month ordeal that saw some of the world's wealthiest people navigate the daunting logistics of sports ownership.</p>\n<p>Moreno, a devoted baseball fan who had presided over the franchise for 20 seasons up to that point, admitted during a spring training media availability that he \"started to get cold feet.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's like the more he talked up the team and tried to sell others on it,\" a source familiar with the process said, \"the more he sold himself on his own product.\"</p>\n<p>The son of Mexican immigrants who returned from the Vietnam War to run a billboard company that turned him into a billionaire, Moreno completed his purchase of the Angels in 2003, following the team's unlikely championship. He lowered beer prices, signed Bartolo Colon and Vladimir Guerrero Sr. and watched as the Angels won five division titles in a six-year stretch. He was celebrated throughout Orange County. In the 13 years that followed, the Angels failed to win a single playoff game, their only appearance resulting in a first-round sweep at the hands of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a> in 2014. Twenty-seven teams clinched at least two postseason berths from 2010 to 2022; the Angels were not one of them.</p>\n<p>Moreno, who employed five different managers and five different general managers during that stretch, has seemingly shouldered most of that blame. His adoration for stars helped turn the Angels into a franchise that resonated on a more national level. But numerous players, coaches and executives previously employed by the team believe his heavy-handedness in baseball operations and aggressive cost-cutting in other areas helped create an exceedingly small margin of error on a yearly basis, making the Angels overly reliant on superstar performances from a handful of players in a sport that requires depth.</p>\n<p>He has been criticized for targeting mega-contracts that quickly became problematic -- particularly those of Vernon Wells, Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a>, the latter three of which came with the loss of draft picks -- and then declining to exceed the luxury tax threshold in an effort to make up for it. He has been criticized for not paying enough attention to the infrastructure that helps organizations develop talent through minor league systems, part of the reason the Angels' farm system has ranked within the bottom eight in the industry by Baseball America seven out of the past 10 years. And he has been criticized for continually cutting costs in many of the behind-the-scenes aspects that would help maximize expensive rosters, from analytics to training resources to staffing hires -- an approach one former pitcher described as \"buying a McLaren and taking it to Jiffy Lube.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Under Moreno's stewardship, the Angels have often existed in what amounts to baseball purgatory: definitely not resetting, but probably not doing enough to truly contend.</p>\n<p>\"He's very competitive to his detriment at times,\" a former Angels executive said. \"Has anyone ever been able to convince [him] of a direction to that goal?\"</p>\n<p>Moreno and the Angels didn't respond to an initial interview request for this story, or to specific follow-up questions based on these comments and the uncertainty of his ownership plans.</p>\n<p>Moreno's GM hirings, all of them first-timers when they got the job, are also to blame. The Angels drafted 321 players under former GMs Jerry Dipoto and Billy Eppler from 2012 to 2020, and only one -- David Fletcher, currently toiling in the minor leagues -- has produced at least 10 Baseball-Reference wins above replacement in the major leagues. Their starting pitcher acquisitions, most of them through free agency, were at least as underwhelming; the Angels' rotation had the lowest FanGraphs WAR in the majors from 2015 to 2020.</p>\n<p>Those who defend Moreno will point out that he consistently spends more on players than two-thirds of Major League Baseball's owners and that he has not stripped the roster bare in an effort to rebuild and cut costs. In recent years, Moreno has also agreed to invest more heavily in analytics. Ohtani, who didn't emerge as a two-way force until 2021, and Trout, who has played in only 236 of his team's 449 games since then, haven't necessarily matched up their primes, either.</p>\n<p>But the Angels' streak of consecutive losing seasons extends to seven. And they're on pace to set a franchise record with their eighth in a row in 2023, after which there are questions at the highest level.</p>\n<p>\"The big concern is with Arte and not knowing what they're doing at the top,\" a person close to the team said. \"Is this a year-by-year thing? Is it five years? That's the No. 1 concern right there.\"</p>\n<p>Moreno turned 77 on Aug. 14. His children are not believed to be interested in inheriting the franchise. There's no consensus about what's next. Some close to Moreno believe he might consider selling the team again if the season continues to spiral and Ohtani heads elsewhere this offseason. Others think that he might take on a minority owner whose stake in the franchise increases over time, a proposition a source said he dismissed earlier this year. Or that he's waiting to finally strike a deal for the ballpark and its surrounding land, agreements the City of Anaheim walked away from twice in the span of a decade. Or that he'll continue to own the Angels in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>\"He's a very, very complicated guy,\" a longtime business associate said. \"My sense is he's going to hold onto it for at least a couple more years, but I don't know that anybody really knows.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>MORENO HAS BUILT</strong> a reputation among rival executives for being impulsive, the opportunities for major deals with the Angels at times fleeting because of it. And so as this year's trade deadline approached, GMs throughout the sport were preparing as if they needed to act on any potential trade for Ohtani quickly -- under the impression, two people in talks with the Angels said, that relatively small events could alter the dynamic in one direction or the other.</p>\n<p>With a little more than two weeks remaining until the trade deadline, the Angels were reeling. They lost nine of 10 to fall below .500 heading into the All-Star break, a stretch that saw Trout and Rendon suffer serious injuries. Then they proceeded to lose two of three to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> to begin the second half, at which point the trade rumors involving Ohtani had reached a fever pitch.</p>\n<p>The popular sentiment throughout the industry had been that Moreno would not trade Ohtani, citing his reluctance to do so last summer, at a time the Angels would have received possibly the biggest return package in history. But after the All-Star break came and went, some of those familiar with the Angels' thinking had begun to believe that Moreno -- and, by extension, his latest GM, Perry Minasian -- would be open to a trade if the losses continued to pile up and the right package presented itself.</p>\n<p>Teams checked in to gauge interest and throw names around early in the second half and were told to wait.</p>\n<p>Instead, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42711/michael-stefanic\">Michael Stefanic</a>, an undrafted player who originally signed for nothing, might have changed the course of baseball history.</p>\n<p>When Stefanic was summoned as a pinch hitter in the 10th inning of a tied game on the night of July 17, with two outs and the winning run on second base, he was a 27-year-old who had accumulated just 80 plate appearances in the major leagues. He grew up in Boise, Idaho, as an avid fan of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a>, and his ensuing walk-off single against his hated <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> marked a turning point.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>On the heels of Stefanic's heroics, the Angels swept the Yankees and won six times in a stretch of seven games leading up to July 26, putting them only four games back of a playoff spot (though their odds of getting there were just 16.7%).</p>\n<p>Within the Angels, a source familiar with the process said, there had been talks of letting the final full week before the trade deadline play out, through stops in Detroit and Toronto, before reaching a decision. Doing so, at least, would have provided the front office with an opportunity to maximize its time and gauge how the Angels perform against a team they were chasing in the wild-card standings. But Moreno clearly didn't need to see much else.</p>\n<p>Ohtani was officially pulled off the trade market in the middle of that stretch. Some of those high up in the front office were not aware of the development until it circulated in the media, sources said, a sign of the lack of synergy that has come to define this franchise over the last decade-plus. The decision was widely believed to have been driven by Moreno, though ownership involvement is commonplace with players of that magnitude.</p>\n<p>Pundits scolded the Angels for their shortsightedness, but the decision to keep Ohtani and add to the current roster -- within hours, the Angels acquired two high-end pitchers, starter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32697/lucas-giolito\">Lucas Giolito</a> and reliever <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33860/reynaldo-lopez\">Reynaldo Lopez</a>, from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a> -- was widely celebrated within the clubhouse. Especially, it seems, by Ohtani. The next day, after twirling a shutout against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a> in Game 1 of a doubleheader and homering twice in Game 2, Ohtani noted through his interpreter that it was \"the first time in my six years that we've been buyers\" before the trade deadline.</p>\n<p>But he remained coy about how that might impact his free agency.</p>\n<p>\"In season, I don't really think about the long-term stuff,\" Ohtani told reporters in Detroit. \"Just focus on this season and every game that's in front of me. Obviously, I've been with the Angels my whole career. I love the fans. I love the team. No complaints. I just want to finish the season strong for the fans and everyone that is cheering for me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I feel like it was more peace of mind for Shohei,\" Angels closer <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34861/carlos-estevez\">Carlos Estevez</a> said in Spanish. \"He didn't know what was going to happen. Although he might seem like a robot, he's a baseball player just like the rest of us.\"</p>\n<p>Three days later, during a flight from Toronto to Atlanta, the team's charter was buzzing about another potential deal, later learned to be the acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32155/cj-cron\">C.J. Cron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31399/randal-grichuk\">Randal Grichuk</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a>. Ohtani in particular seemed animated, according to one staffer on board.</p>\n<p>To that person, it served as a rare glimmer of hope for the Angels' future -- a sign that maybe showing Ohtani they'll do whatever it takes will go a long way toward swaying him to stay.</p>\n<p>\"He's a competitor,\" Angels starting pitcher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40975/patrick-sandoval\">Patrick Sandoval</a> said. \"He wants to win, just like everybody else in here. The fact that we're buyers at the deadline and having the front office's support -- because they could've easily cashed it in and got us some prospects for the future. But the way that they did it, we're f---ing pumped about it. Yeah, that goes a long way.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><strong>THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY</strong> might scoff at them, but Moreno and the Angels appear to believe they have a legitimate chance at keeping Ohtani. They believe he's comfortable in Orange County, that he recognizes the autonomy he has been granted and that he appreciates how Minasian fostered his two-way prowess by shedding prior restrictions and believing in his talent, even when injuries and struggles made others skeptical. At some point in the near future, Moreno is expected to offer Ohtani and his CAA agent, Nez Balelo, a massive contract extension in hopes that they will eschew lucrative offers from a variety of suitors this winter, including the crosstown-rival <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>.</p>\n<p>Every team wants Ohtani.</p>\n<p>The Angels, more so than anyone else, seemingly <em>need </em>him.</p>\n<p>Their farm system is once again devoid of high-impact talent and their major league roster possesses some glaring pitfalls, most notably Rendon, who has played in less than 35% of the Angels' games over the past three years and is owed $114 million over the <em>next </em>three years. Trout, recently plagued by calf, back and hand injuries, hasn't played a full season since 2016 and is signed through 2030. There's a thought that adding an Ohtani contract, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/35439378/why-shohei-ohtani-poised-become-mlb-first-500m-man\">expected to be worth at least $500 million</a>, would only make it harder for the Angels to win moving forward.</p>\n<p>But what, exactly, are they without him?</p>\n<p>\"I understand the sentiment of, 'Sell everything, rebuild,' all those types of things,\" Minasian said. \"I understand that. But when you have a special player, who I don't know if we'll ever see again, having a special season, when you have a team around him performing, keeping their head above water with a chance to win every night -- I feel like the team deserved a chance to win. And I think there's real value in that, especially for our younger players.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels increased their payroll to nearly $215 million on Opening Day, nearly a 15% increase from the previous franchise record. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4666100/zach-neto\">Zach Neto</a>, their 2022 first-round pick, was called up as the everyday shortstop in April after just 44 minor league games. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4739755/nolan-schanuel\">Nolan Schanuel</a>, their 2023 first-round pick, was called up to fill in at first base in August after <em>21 </em>minor league games. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4867388/ben-joyce\">Ben Joyce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4621489/sam-bachman\">Sam Bachman</a>, pitching prospects taken within the last two drafts, were brought up to help in the bullpen. When injuries began to take a toll on their infield in late June, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/29999/mike-moustakas\">Mike Moustakas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30272/eduardo-escobar\">Eduardo Escobar</a> were acquired via trade. In late July, Grichuk and Cron were brought in to replace <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34923/taylor-ward\">Taylor Ward</a>, who had been struck in the face by a fastball, and provide Ohtani with some much-needed protection in the lineup.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>For those additions, the Angels shed seven prospects from a system that began the season <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/35490490/top-30-mlb-farm-systems-prospects-list-2023-kiley-mcdaniel\">ranked 26th in the majors by ESPN's Kiley McDaniel</a>, including their two best ones, Ky Bush and Edgar Quero. There's good news and bad news to that: Scouts don't believe the Angels gave up anybody who has much of a chance to become an impact player, but that's because they don't have those players in their system to begin with. Trading Ohtani could have infused the Angels with some much-needed young talent. Instead they face the possibility of getting only a compensatory draft pick for the most unique player in baseball history.</p>\n<p>At some point, they -- or, perhaps, just Moreno -- realized it was even worse to never let it play out.</p>\n<p>\"Other stars have left, other teams have gotten draft picks -- they don't fold the franchise,\" Minasian said. \"You can recover from that. That being said, we wanted to give ourselves the best chance to have a successful season and play meaningful games in September and hopefully get to October.\"</p>\n<p>And so every loss feels like a gut punch, every win a temporary reprieve from despondency. It has been six years since the Angels were even relevant for the stretch run of a regular season, which is why simply keeping pace into September is so important. By that point, their schedule will soften, Trout will be back and the thought was that perhaps the Angels might have an outside shot.</p>\n<p>But the odds feel continually more daunting. Over the last 50 years, only three teams -- the 2011 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, 2011 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a> and the 1974 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a> -- have overcome at least an eight-game deficit with no more than 37 games remaining to make the playoffs, according to research from the Elias Sports Bureau. The Angels would have to do so while jumping three teams.</p>\n<p>The past nine months or so have seen Moreno reverse course on old habits that previously set the franchise back, specifically spreading his money out on quality depth pieces in free agency, rather than splurging on one star, and then agreeing to exceed the luxury tax threshold in order to make additions at midseason. In that time, a stable of young players have developed into formidable big leaguers, namely Neto, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42047/logan-ohoppe\">Logan O'Hoppe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36181/mickey-moniak\">Mickey Moniak</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4326697/reid-detmers\">Reid Detmers</a>, a circumstance Minasian points to as a reason to be optimistic about the future.</p>\n<p>But Ohtani's free agency beckons.</p>\n<p>\"I'm trying not to look ahead like that,\" Trout said, \"but it's gonna become a reality, obviously, in the offseason when that last game is played and he becomes a free agent. I haven't really thought about what it's gonna be like without him because I hope he comes back.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>HOUSTON -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> hit off a pitching machine Friday for the first time since fracturing his left hamate bone and manager Phil Nevin said the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Angels</a>' star outfielder is moving closer to a return.</p>\n<p>Trout has been out since July 3 and Nevin said before the start of a series with the Astros that the team believes he's close, but that there still isn't a timetable for his return.</p>\n<p>\"There's going to be some hot spots around the wrist,\" Nevin said. \"It's natural when these things happen with this surgery.

In many cases, though, teams were also banking on a return of some impact players -- at a time when injuries are dominating the baseball landscape.</p>\n<p>The 2023 season was 124 days old by the end of July, and already there had been 610 stints on the injured list. That's the third-most through that many days in the last 40 years, according to ESPN Stats & Information. The two years ahead of it: 2021 and 2022. The two years behind it: 2018 and 2017. A lot of that might be a function of the shorter 10-day IL, which teams often exploit for roster maneuverability. But once again there have been a plethora of big names who have suffered major injuries this summer.</p>\n<p>Many of them have either come back recently or will do so in the near future, perhaps providing a greater impact on the standings than any player who was traded in recent days.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 of the most important.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Players who can secure a pennant</h2>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/lad.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39251/walker-buehler\">Walker Buehler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Sometime in September. Buehler is in the late stages of recovery from his second Tommy John surgery, which occurred seven years after his first. He has been throwing bullpen sessions in Arizona and could soon progress to facing hitters. Buehler's previously stated goal was to return as a full-fledged member of the Dodgers' starting rotation on the first day of September. And though club officials deemed that to be overly optimistic -- he'd barely be 12 months removed from getting his ulnar collateral ligament replaced at that point -- they were also hesitant to doubt him. Last week, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts called getting Buehler back in some capacity before the end of the regular season \"a viable possibility.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: The Dodgers are somehow in first place in the National League West -- with the sport's fourth-highest run-differential, no less -- despite a mess of a starting rotation. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33223/julio-urias\">Julio Urias</a> has been up and down, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40937/dustin-may\">Dustin May</a> has been lost for the year, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard\">Noah Syndergaard</a> was practically un-pitchable before getting traded and Clayton Kershaw has been on the injured list with a shoulder injury for the last five weeks. Kershaw, pitching like a legitimate Cy Young candidate before going down, could return within a matter of days. And if Buehler can tap back into his prior form, the Dodgers could suddenly boast a dynamic top of the rotation heading into October. Buehler has already established himself as one of the most prolific postseason performers in franchise history. His presence could change everything.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/atl.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32685/max-fried\">Max Fried</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Friday against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a>. Fried, out since early May with a forearm strain, threw 79 pitches and recorded 13 outs for the Braves' Triple-A affiliate on Saturday. It was his fourth and likely final rehab start. Fried allowed five runs on 11 hits, two of them homers, in a combined 7⅔ innings in his two appearances with the Gwinnett Stripers. But all that matters is that he is seemingly healthy. \"Physically I feel great,\" Fried told reporters Wednesday night. \"Now it's just about going out there and continuing to get sharp, locate pitches and try to win baseball games.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: It's amazing, given their dominance, that the Braves have received only five starts from one of their best pitchers. Fried, who also missed some time with a groin strain he suffered on Opening Day, finished second in NL Cy Young Award voting last year. In his first 26 innings this year, he was charged with only six earned runs. The 29-year-old left-hander is one of the sport's best pitchers when healthy, and it's scary to think about how he might impact <em>these </em>Braves. Atlanta leads the majors in winning percentage, run differential, OPS and home runs. Now Fried will join a staff that includes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4307825/spencer-strider\">Spencer Strider</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/29155/charlie-morton\">Charlie Morton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4301067/bryce-elder\">Bryce Elder</a>, a trio that has combined for a 3.47 ERA in 64 starts.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Players who can decide a division</h2>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cin.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39635/hunter-greene\">Hunter Greene</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Possibly Aug. 20 against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>. Greene had been battling discomfort in his hips for a few weeks and finally landed on the injured list around the middle of June. Less than six weeks later, on July 28, Greene threw live batting practice and pumped his fastball up to 99 mph. On Tuesday, he threw two scoreless innings with the team's Arizona Complex League club. A couple more starts in the minor leagues should be enough for him to make his way back.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: The Reds are young and exciting and dynamic. But they could badly use the type of boost Greene is capable of providing. Their bullpen has absorbed the seventh-most innings in the major leagues. Six of their relievers -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4905920/alexis-diaz\">Alexis Diaz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33627/buck-farmer\">Buck Farmer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37979/ian-gibaut\">Ian Gibaut</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32807/lucas-sims\">Lucas Sims</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34972/alex-young\">Alex Young</a> and the newly acquired <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34928/sam-moll\">Sam Moll</a> -- have made at least 45 appearances already.

Greene, who had a 3.93 ERA and 100 strikeouts in 73⅓ innings before going down, could join forces with an impressive <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4414528/andrew-abbott\">Andrew Abbott</a> and change the outlook of the Reds' rotation for the stretch run. So might lefty <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42433/nick-lodolo\">Nick Lodolo</a>, who could return from his leg injury before the end of August.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/hou.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35759/jose-urquidy\">Jose Urquidy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Probably before the end of this week. Urquidy had been out since the start of May with inflammation in his pitching shoulder, but his return is nigh. Urquidy has completed four rehab starts, the last of which saw him throw 76 pitches on Sunday, and should be activated off the injured list in the coming days. Earlier this week, Urquidy said he felt as if the quality of his pitches was the same as it had been while posting a 3.81 ERA in 271⅓ innings from 2021 to 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/6341/justin-verlander\">Justin Verlander</a>, acquired from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> on Tuesday, will have the biggest impact, of course. But don't overlook the return of Urquidy, which should come less than two weeks after the simultaneous activation of two of their best hitters, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36018/yordan-alvarez\">Yordan Alvarez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31662/jose-altuve\">Jose Altuve</a>.

In Verlander, Urquidy, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41261/cristian-javier\">Cristian Javier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717803/hunter-brown\">Hunter Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/3662290/jp-france\">J.P. France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36581/framber-valdez\">Framber Valdez</a>, who threw a no-hitter on Tuesday, the Astros will boast six capable starters for the final two months of the regular season. It's the type of depth that helped win them a World Series last fall.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37515/brandon-woodruff\">Brandon Woodruff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Perhaps as early as Sunday against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. Woodruff made only two starts -- two excellent ones, mind you -- before experiencing what was later diagnosed as a sub-scapular strain in his right shoulder. It left him rehabbing for the better part of the next four months. But now Woodruff is on the cusp of his return. He made his third rehab start on Tuesday, throwing 72 pitches for the Brewers' Triple-A affiliate in Nashville, Tennessee. His next start could come in the major leagues, for a Brewers team fighting to stay atop a relatively inferior NL Central.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: The Brewers added some power before the trade deadline, acquiring <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31670/mark-canha\">Mark Canha</a> from the Mets and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30280/carlos-santana\">Carlos Santana</a> from the Pirates. But their biggest additions are coming to the rotation, with Wade Miley returning on Wednesday and Woodruff following shortly thereafter. Woodruff and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39878/corbin-burnes\">Corbin Burnes</a> combined for a 2.73 ERA in 835 innings from 2020 to 2022, forming one of the best rotation duos in the sport. Burnes got off to a rough start this year but dominated in July, posting a 1.85 ERA with 47 strikeouts in 39 innings. If Woodruff returns to form -- a tall order given both his injury and the extent of his absence, but not impossible -- it might be enough for Milwaukee to hold on for a division title.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Players who can shake up the wild-card race</h2>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41433/jazz-chisholm-jr\">Jazz Chisholm Jr</a>., <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Just got back. Chisholm was activated off the IL on Monday, after missing almost the entire month of July with an oblique strain. The 25-year-old is widely considered a budding superstar, but he has been on the IL six times since his first full season in 2021, most notably for the entire second half last year. This time, the Marlins wasted no time getting Chisholm back. His rehab stint in Jupiter, Florida, lasted three plate appearances. The next day, he was back in the major leagues, starting in center field -- a position he has taken to well this season -- and batting cleanup.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: The Marlins have elevated themselves as legitimate contenders this season, thanks in large part to the offseason acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39572/luis-arraez\">Luis Arraez</a> and the resurgence of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32558/jorge-soler\">Jorge Soler</a>. But they need more offense, a glaring issue over the last few years in Miami. Chisholm is the type of player who can spark their lineup. He was slashing only .246/.302/.443 when he got hurt for the second time this season, down from his .254/.325/.535 mark from last year. But the thought with Chisholm has often been that there's more in there, and that he just needs consistent playing time in order to tap into it. The stretch run of 2023 would be the perfect time for him to finally reach his potential. The Marlins, who made win-now moves in acquiring Jake Burger, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32517/josh-bell\">Josh Bell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/29172/david-robertson\">David Robertson</a> before the trade deadline, went 9-12 without Chisholm in July. They need a spark.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tor.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32582/hyun-jin-ryu\">Hyun Jin Ryu</a>, Toronto Blue Jays</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Just got back. Ryu made his return from Tommy John surgery in a start against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a> on Tuesday and got roughed up a bit, giving up four runs on nine hits in five innings. It marked the end of a 14-month process for the 36-year-old left-hander. Ryu made four minor league rehab starts and was sharp throughout, giving up only four runs in 18 innings while issuing just one walk. He got all the way up to six innings in the last of those appearances and is not expected to have any restrictions moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: The Blue Jays have too many starting pitchers now, if you can believe that. Ryu's return is prompting them to go with a six-man rotation at least for the near future -- and that is a welcome development for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32667/kevin-gausman\">Kevin Gausman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32811/jose-berrios\">Jose Berrios</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33148/chris-bassitt\">Chris Bassitt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41415/yusei-kikuchi\">Yusei Kikuchi</a>, who had to carry the load while Ryu recovered and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42436/alek-manoah\">Alek Manoah</a> worked out his issues in the minor leagues. Four starts into his return, Manoah has at least shown signs of improvement after an awful start to his season. Berrios is experiencing a dramatic turnaround from last season. Gausman has pitched like an ace. And Kikuchi and Bassitt have been solid. Ryu takes the Blue Jays' staff to yet another level at a time when they're fighting within a crowded AL wild-card race. It's probably wise not to put too much stock into his first outing back against Baltimore's dynamic offense.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32150/trevor-story\">Trevor Story</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Perhaps next week. Story underwent an internal bracing procedure of the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow in early January, about a month after the man he was expected to replace, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31606/xander-bogaerts\">Xander Bogaerts</a>, was lost to free agency. But Story is finally nearing the tail end of his recovery. The initial hope was to activate him for Friday's game against the Blue Jays, but that has been pushed back a tad. He should return at some point before the Red Sox wrap their 10-game homestand on Aug. 13, however. Story -- signed to a six-year, $140 million contract in March of 2022 -- also missed about a month and a half last season with what was later diagnosed as a hairline fracture in his right wrist.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: Red Sox shortstops have combined to produce a .599 OPS this season. Only the lowly <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/oak/oakland-athletics\">Oakland Athletics</a> have produced a lower mark. Story, a two-time Silver Slugger, will no doubt improve that. But he'll only do so dramatically if he can regain the form he displayed down the stretch in 2022. Story slashed .340/.389/.500 in his final 13 games after returning from his wrist injury last season, putting a positive end to what had been a miserable first season in Boston. That's the guy the Red Sox need if they hope to overcome the odds and earn a playoff berth in a crowded AL. The return of starting pitcher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30948/chris-sale\">Chris Sale</a>, who could be back from a stress reaction in his left shoulder in a week or two, might be just as big a boost.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Mid to late August. Trout fractured the hamate bone in his left hand on a swing on July 3, undergoing surgery two days later. A typical recovery timeline for that injury is six to eight weeks. Trout was taking dry swings right before the end of July, and the Angels will gradually add a little more to his plate in hopes of getting him back as quickly as possible. He'll probably have to play through some pain initially, but he is nonetheless eager to return. Trout has missed significant time to injury each of the last three years.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: The Angels have put everything into this year, potentially their last one with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>. And while Trout has been on the mend, the team has fought hard in hopes of remaining in contention. A brutal stretch in which the Angels lost 11 of 13 games has been followed by 10 wins in a span of 15 games. The front office, swayed by the team's hot stretch, proceeded to pull Ohtani off the table and make win-now trades, acquiring four rentals in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32697/lucas-giolito\">Lucas Giolito</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33860/reynaldo-lopez\">Reynaldo Lopez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32155/cj-cron\">C.J. Cron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31399/randal-grichuk\">Randal Grichuk</a>. But the Angels badly need the three-time MVP back in their lineup. Without Trout, Ohtani was intentionally walked nine times in the month of July. The return of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42047/logan-o'hoppe\">Logan O'Hoppe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a> will help, too, but Trout has continued to prove he's one of the two or three best players in the world when he's out on the field. He just needs to get back there.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Players who can ... make an anemic offense seem competent</h2>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nyy.png&h=60&w=60\" width=\"30\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected return date</strong>: Just got back. Judge jammed his right big toe against an unpadded concrete strip below the right-field fence at Dodger Stadium on June 3, penetrating the bullpen door while making a spectacular catch. The injury wound up being more severe than initially anticipated. He was ultimately diagnosed with a torn ligament and missed nearly eight weeks, gradually building up baseball activities before finally getting activated in Baltimore on Friday -- and not a moment too soon. The ligament, Judge said upon returning, is stable. But the Yankees will be cautious, as evidenced by them sitting him with the series on the line the following Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>What he means to the team</strong>: Judge should finish second to Ohtani in American League MVP voting simply because of how the Yankees looked in his absence. When he went down, they were 10 games above .500 and 2½ games up on the final AL wild-card spot. They then proceeded to go 19-23 in his absence, dropping to 2½ games <em>behind </em>in the wild-card race. As a unit, the offense slashed .220/.296/.374 without Judge, producing the fourth-lowest OPS in the sport. It would be unfair to label Judge a savior, but he's also the reigning MVP. And he was OPS'ing 1.078 with 19 home runs in 49 games when he got hurt. ESPN's Bradford Doolittle calculated estimated win changes for each of these returning players, and Judge was unsurprisingly projected to have the greatest impact. Doolittle's model had him contributing an additional 2.06 wins and 22.4 runs down the stretch -- the latter number nearly three times more than any other position player on this list. The Yankees will get starter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36480/nestor-cortes\">Nestor Cortes</a> back this weekend and could get reliever <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39807/jonathan-loaisiga\">Jonathan Loaisiga</a> back next week, but nobody can make an impact like Judge.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Sure, his current OPS is .851, which is still 25th among qualifiers and worthy of All-Star attention, and he may reach 40 home runs yet again and flirt with 100 RBIs and 100 runs for the first time since 2019. That said, was he worth a top-20 fantasy pick? Definitely not.</p>\n<p>Trout attempted his first stolen base a few weeks ago, so that's one problem, but the .255 batting average is a real downer, and it's not BABIP-anchored. Trout's managers can focus on the positive, though. The power remains significant, and he is on pace for his most games/PA since 2016. Everything else is a bit concerning, including the FB/GB rates, which may continue to cap his batting average.</p>\n<p>Trout is the No. 85 option on the Player Rater, behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32558/jorge-soler\">Jorge Soler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35066/josh-naylor\">Josh Naylor</a>, yet he's missed only five games. This is concerning indeed, and makes him more like a fourth- or fifth-round choice in 2024.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/32269.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> Leaguemates made fun of me when I invested in Angels <strong>3B/1B/2B <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32269/brandon-drury\">Brandon Drury</a></strong> several rounds earlier than his standard \"ranking\" in one of my leagues, because who expected this journeyman to replicate his 2022 breakout ever again? Well, in truth, I did not, but versatile infielders with even modest power matter. Drury hit .263-28-87 for the Reds and Padres last season, and he's doing almost the same exact thing now, with his .813 OPS from 2022 up a tad (sure, with much thanks to Saturday's big game) to .815.</p>\n<p>Drury's plate discipline and contact is even worse than it was last season, and there is some risk here since he doesn't hit enough fly balls to warrant 30 blasts, but these numbers work in roto leagues. Honestly, it seems like half the time when leaguemates chuckle about someone's draft-day pick or auction investment it turns out months later to be unwarranted. Nobody knows for sure in March! And now, at the tail end of June, Drury ranks 77th among hitters on the Rater, while Trout is only No. 49.</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/32098.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> Many of us long ago gave up on <strong>3B <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a></strong>, currently on the IL again, this time due to a bruised wrist. Oh, what a terrific player Rendon used to be with Washington. This fellow hit .319 with 34 HR and 126 RBIs in 2019! He has hit just .251 with 21 total home runs and 110 RBIs over 195 games and 838 PA in the four years since, succumbing often to physical woes. Health is a skill. Rendon lacks it, and he has hit just one home run. Stop investing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/30272.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> <img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/29999.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> Weekend trades for <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30272/eduardo-escobar\">Eduardo Escobar</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/29999/mike-moustakas\">Mike Moustakas</a></strong> are notable. The Angels cannot trust in Rendon or 1B <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35673/jared-walsh\">Jared Walsh</a>, and they needed to replace injured 3B/1B <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32721/gio-urshela\">Gio Urshela</a>. The beleaguered Mets didn't need Escobar because <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42414/brett-baty\">Brett Baty</a> is better. Escobar scored four runs in his Angels debut Saturday and, as with Drury, those seeking power in roto leagues should have interest here. Escobar hit 20 home runs last season and 28 in 2021. He will play regularly, even when Rendon returns.</p>\n<p>Moustakas came over from the Rockies mere minutes after the 25-1 rout. I was rooting for Walsh, who smacked 29 home runs in 2021, after his 2022 campaign was ruined by an injury that necessitated surgery to aid thoracic outlet syndrome, a malady that often truncates pitching careers. Walsh has been dealing with insomnia and migraines this year. Moustakas is a platoon bat we can probably avoid, but there is some pop there. Drury can play second base, but he really shouldn't. I am interested in seeing what the Angels lineup looks like this week.</p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/36181.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> Phillies fans continue to ask my thoughts on <strong>OF <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36181/mickey-moniak\">Mickey Moniak</a></strong>, the failed No. 1 pick from the moribund 2016 draft who, on the surface, looks mighty rejuvenated these days. Moniak hit a sad .129 over only 105 PA over parts of three seasons with the Phillies, never truly given an opportunity -- and he wasn't consistently awesome in the minors, either.</p>\n<p>Well, Moniak had five hits Saturday, including a home run, three doubles and five runs. Ohtani is the lone Angels hitter -- including Trout -- who is averaging more <i>fantasy points per game</i> this season. Moniak is hitting .337 and slugging .707 in brief duty. He has seven home runs and even has two stolen bases in his 27 games. Notably, he also has three walks versus 30 strikeouts and is a pure platoon bat who cannot touch lefties.</p>\n<p>Don't invest in fantasy. This cannot remotely continue.</p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/42047.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> I loved the brief offensive contributions from rookie <strong>C <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42047/logan-o'hoppe\">Logan O'Hoppe</a></strong> (also a former Phillie, acquired in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard\">Noah Syndergaard</a> rental) until he wrecked his non-throwing shoulder, and there is no reasonable insight that he will return this season. Next year, he'll be top-10 catcher! Perhaps. Former corner infielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36176/matt-thaiss\">Matt Thaiss</a> -- now a catcher! -- homered on Saturday and, thanks to the many walks, is an option for multi-catcher points formats.</p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/4666100.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> Rookie <strong>SS <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4666100/zach-neto\">Zach Neto</a></strong> may come off the IL after his oblique strain in a week, and fantasy managers absolutely should invest in deeper formats. Neto is a volume numbers guy, with six home runs and five steals in fewer than 200 PA. Plate discipline was an issue early on, but unlike the Yankees' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42547/anthony-volpe\">Anthony Volpe</a>, Neto had improved in that area before the injury. Neto may be leading off for the Angels after the All-Star break, and a top-10 fantasy shortstop lurks. Those who add soft-hitting 2B/SS <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35156/david-fletcher\">David Fletcher</a> after his four-hit, five-RBIs game on Saturday are making a mistake.</p>\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/40854.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> Nobody roots for injuries, but that seems like the only way slugging <strong>OF <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40854/jo-adell\">Jo Adell</a> </strong>will get another shot with the Angels. He really needs a trade. Adell has hit 21 home runs in 66 games for Triple-A Salt Lake (which isn't so unusual in the Pacific Coast League) and he mashed one 451 feet in his Angels debut earlier this month. It was his only game with the team. It's weird.</p>\n<p>The Angels don't seem to want Adell, so why not move him for pitching! Adell, 24, always had both power and contact question marks. Last season, in 284 Angels PA, he walked 3.7% of the time, and whiffed 37.7% of the time. That's bad. Perhaps he could be another Soler-type if he were on the Royals. I wouldn't give up on him yet in dynasty roto formats.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

The club will be built in Trout's birthplace of Vineland, New Jersey, which is about 40 miles south of Philadelphia. Construction is scheduled to begin this year. They hope the club will be open to members in 2025.</p>\n<p>The club will also include a practice range, short-game area, clubhouse, lodging and wedding chapel, according to a news release.</p>\n<p>Trout grew up in Millville, New Jersey, about 7 miles from the location of the course. He and his wife, Jessica, still live in the area, as do his parents, siblings and in-laws.</p>\n<p>\"I could put down roots anywhere in the country, but Jessica and I make south Jersey our off-season home and always cherish the time we get to spend there,\" Trout said in a news release. \"I love south Jersey and I love golf, so creating Trout National-The Reserve is a dream come true. And then to add to that we'll have a golf course designed by Tiger? It's just incredible to think that this project has grown to where we're going to be working with someone many consider the greatest and most influential golfer of all time.\"</p>\n<p>Local businesspeople John and Lorie Ruga are also partners in the project.</p>\n<p>\"I've always enjoyed watching Mike on the diamond so when the opportunity arose to work with him on Trout National-The Reserve, I couldn't pass it up,\" Woods said in a statement. \"It's a great site for golf and our team's looking forward to creating a special course for Mike, Jessica, John and Lorie.\"</p>\n<p>The golf course will be built on the location of a former silica sand mine, according to the release.</p>\n<p>Trout isn't the first celebrity to own his own golf course.

  "<p>MIAMI -- The two best baseball players in the world's eyes locked for a split second, long enough to acknowledge each other and the sheer improbability of what was happening.</p>\n<p>Top of the ninth. Two outs. A one-run game. In the batter's box stood <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, and on the pitcher's mound was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>. When this was over, they would again be <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> teammates, but in this moment, this perfect moment, they were foes.</p>\n<p>Three minutes later, when the at-bat of a lifetime ended, Ohtani was mobbed by his Samurai Japan teammates, the new World Baseball Classic champions, and Trout was skulking back to the Team USA dugout, having swung through a frisbee slider on a full count that cemented Japan's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/world-baseball-classic/boxscore/_/gameId/401507523\">3-2 victory</a> Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>In a tournament that had everything, a three-week sprint that brought the intensity and stakes of October baseball to March, it was only fitting that the dream scenario played out in the most dramatic of fashions.</p>\n<p>\"I believe this is the best moment in my life,\" said Ohtani, the 28-year-old two-way player who by sheer force wrested away the title of best player alive from Trout, whose grip on it seemed unbreakable.</p>\n<p>The two aren't just generational players. They are all-timers, the best of the best, and the crowd of 36,058 at LoanDepot Park, accompanied by tens of millions of viewers around the globe, witnessed the mathematically improbable turn real then metamorphose into something even better.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The possibility of the moment emerged immediately after Samurai Japan, as the No. 1-ranked team in international baseball is nicknamed, clinched a WBC final spot Monday night with a breathtaking <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35907788/japan-plates-2-ninth-downs-mexico-world-baseball-classic\">walk-off win against Mexico</a>. The reigning Olympic gold medalists arrived ran roughshod through pool play and the quarterfinals, hopeful they would meet the powerful Team USA, with its countless All-Stars and billion-dollar lineup, in the final. When they did, a great baseball game broke out, full of matchups between elite hitters and pitchers, featuring mistake-free defense, ever ready to tilt in either team's favor.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the night, Ohtani led his team down the third-base line holding the Japanese flag, while Trout did the same along the first-base line with the Stars and Stripes. Though they stopped short of the plate, it was as though they were presaged to meet there eventually.</p>\n<p>\"As a baseball fan, everybody wanted to see it,\" Trout said. \"He won Round 1.\"</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it was by knockout, with Ohtani dispatching Trout from the box and Team USA from a tournament that nearly chewed it up in pool play. The mighty Dominican Republic had lost before the knockout round, the WBC far from a chalk affair, so to see Japan vs. USA, and to imagine Ohtani vs. Trout like the tiniest nesting doll inside of it, tantalized baseball fans old and new.</p>\n<p>And then it happened at 10:40 p.m. ET, after Ohtani, pitching in relief for the first time since clinching a Japan Series appearance for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in 2016, induced a double play from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a>, erasing his leadoff walk to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33900/jeff-mcneil\">Jeff McNeil</a>. Ohtani had entered the game after warming up between at-bats as a designated hitter, and his slow, calculated walk to the mound -- the product of him awaiting a replay review -- nevertheless looked straight out of a Western, the big, strong man with his hat pulled down sauntering toward trouble.</p>\n<p>Trout, walking off the field, looked over his shoulder and stole a glance, fully aware that he was due up third. By the time he made it into the batter's box, they saw each other and the unspoken was obvious: This was the biggest at-bat of their careers, seeing as Ohtani's five seasons with the Angels have produced zero playoff appearances and Trout's one postseason, in 2014, ended with a sweep at the hands of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a>. Trout took a deep breath, settled himself and readied for what was to come: power vs. power, skill vs. skill, greatness vs. greatness.</p>\n<p>\"I thought it was like a manga,\" Japan outfielder Kazuma Okamoto said, \"like a comic book.\"</p>\n<p>Trout stared at an 88 mph slider just below the zone for ball one, and the battle was on. In July, when Trout was named the captain for Team USA, he pledged to recruit the sort of team that could help the Americans repeat as WBC champions. He had never played in the tournament before, and as it went along -- as his friendship with Betts deepened, as he remembered what it was like to play in games that felt like they mattered -- the meaning of the WBC sharpened in his mind.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>\"It was probably the funnest 10 days I've ever had,\" Trout said, later continuing: \"I can't really express what's different about it. You can just feel it in your veins. It's a special, special feeling.\"</p>\n<p>The second pitch, a fastball, blew by Trout's mighty swing at 100 mph. It was Ohtani announcing his presence in a fashion few pitchers can. He had thrown another 100 mph heater earlier in the day, delivering a pregame speech to Samurai Japan that urged the team to regard itself on the same plane as its superstar-laden opponent.</p>\n<p>\"Let's stop admiring them,\" Ohtani said. \"If you admire them, you can't surpass them. We came here to surpass them, to reach the top. For one day, let's throw away our admiration for them and just think about winning.\"</p>\n<p>Ohtani returned to the fastball on the third pitch and yanked it outside to move the count to 2-1. The at-bat could have ended here with a weak grounder or a soft single or a gap double or any of an infinite number of permutations, but the game was not yet done with Ohtani vs. Trout.</p>\n<p>\"With Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout ending that game the way they did, I think baseball won again,\" said <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4448736/lars-nootbaar\">Lars Nootbaar</a>, the Los Angeles-born-and-raised <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a> outfielder who had become a cult hero leading off for Samurai Japan. \"I just think this WBC as a whole kind of elevated the game, and I hope the exposure that it got creates baseball fans all over the world.\"</p>\n<p>Ohtani also elevated, throwing a high fastball at 100 mph past a swinging Trout again on the fourth pitch. The at-bat was turning into something bigger, something memorable, something that helped inspire Ohtani to play in the tournament despite the vagaries of two-way play making a normal 162-game season a marathon.</p>\n<p>\"I've seen Japan winning, and I just wanted to be part of it,\" Ohtani said. \"I really appreciate that I was able to have the great experience. As I say, the next generation, the kids who are playing baseball, I was hoping that those people would like to play baseball. That would make me happy.\"</p>\n<p>The fifth pitch, another fastball, this one at 101.6 mph, spiked into the ground, because if Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout are going to face each other for the first time ever, it had to be epic.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>\"He's got nasty stuff,\" Trout said. \"He's throwing 101, 102. He threw me a good pitch at the end.\"</p>\n<p>The best pitch of all was the sixth, an 87 mph slider, the sweepy sort that starts on the inside corner and ends up outside the strike zone. Trout swung and missed. Japan exulted, destiny fulfilled. Team USA sulked, opportunity blown. The Americans had gone 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position, didn't cash in on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33712/kyle-schwarber\">Kyle Schwarber</a> home runs and couldn't keep Japan's offense in check long enough -- and it made them vulnerable to one of the best sliders in the world inducing the rare three-swing-and-misses strikeout by Trout.</p>\n<p>\"That slider was nasty,\" Team USA third baseman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31261/nolan-arenado\">Nolan Arenado</a> said. \"It was a great pitch. If Mike Trout's not hitting it, I don't think anybody else is.\"</p>\n<p>Trout took no solace in that. He wanted so badly to win, and he didn't. Ohtani was the one on the field taking celebratory pictures with the WBC gold medal hanging from his neck -- with Roki Sasaki, the 21-year-old fireballer who will eventually join Ohtani in MLB, and another with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32055/yu-darvish\">Yu Darvish</a>, now the elder statesman of Japanese pitchers.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the stadium, Trout spoke to the media, hooked a left and walked down the tunnel, fidgeting with his phone and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35913858/mlb-rob-manfred-pushes-more-star-pitchers-next-wbc\">thinking about 2026</a>. He'll be back in that WBC, he said, and he plans on bringing an even better team with him, one that can beat Japan.</p>\n<p>\"Next time,\" Trout said, \"I want to make sure everybody buys in.\"</p>\n<p>For anyone who watched the championship on Tuesday, how couldn't they? More than eight innings of high-level baseball gave way to the highest-level matchup imaginable, and it exceeded expectations. The at-bat personified the tournament itself, great from start to finish -- particularly finish. When Trout returns in 2026, he'll have company. In the aftermath of his greatest victory, Shohei Ohtani said he'll be back too. And if the baseball gods are still smiling on the WBC, it will include Round 2.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Tuesday night's World Baseball Classic final between the United States and Japan featured some of the best Major League Baseball players in the world. </p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>It all came down to USA outfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> batting against his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>. With two outs in the ninth inning and the USA trailing 3-2, Ohtani managed to strike out Trout to secure the title for Japan.</p>\n\n\n<p>It's always a treat when two incredible teammates face off. Here are some other examples we're remembering since the turn of the century.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Lionel Messi vs. Kylian Mbappe (2022 FIFA World Cup)</h2>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>The Paris Saint-Germain teammates put on a show in the World Cup final between Argentina and France. Messi's early penalty looked to be the difference in the game and Argentina was sitting on a 2-0 lead into the 80th minute. Mbappe put the team on his back, however, scoring on a penalty in the 80th and a volley in the 81st to send things to extra time. Messi looked to have the winning goal again in the 108th minute, but Mbappe scored again on a penalty in the 118th to become just the second player in history to record a hat trick in the men's World Cup final. Both players scored on their penalty tries, but Argentina ended up winning out.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Kobe Bryant vs. Pau Gasol (2008 Summer Olympics)</h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>Spain was the reigning FIBA world champion at the Summer Olympics but had to face off against the \"Redeem Team.\" Kobe Bryant led a squad featuring <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>, Dwyane Wade and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul\">Chris Paul</a>, all coached by Mike Krzyzewski. Gasol put up 21 points to his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> teammate Bryant's 20, but the USA prevailed 118-108.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Sue Bird vs. Lauren Jackson (2004 Summer Olympics)</h2>\n<p><photo4></p>\n<p>Bird and Jackson were anchors of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/sea/seattle-storm\">Seattle Storm</a> during the team's 2004 championship run. When the USA faced off against Australia in the women's basketball gold-medal game, Bird was mostly on the bench, with Jackson leading both teams in rebounds. The USA led the entire game and pulled ahead significantly in the fourth quarter, winning the gold medal with a 74-63 performance.</p>\n\n\n<h2>2010 Olympic men's hockey gold-medal game</h2>\n<p><photo5></p>\n<p>Some big names here -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-penguins\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> teammates <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114/sidney-crosby\">Sidney Crosby</a> (Canada) and Brooks Orpik (USA) faced off, as did <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-blackhawks\">Chicago Blackhawks</a> stars <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3669/jonathan-toews\">Jonathan Toews</a> (Canada) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3735/patrick-kane\">Patrick Kane</a> (USA). The real kicker, however, was Ryan Kresler scoring for the USA against his <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/van/vancouver-canucks\">Vancouver Canucks</a> teammate Roberto Luongo. Fortunately for Luongo, Canada prevailed 3-2 in overtime.</p>\n\n\n<h2>2002 Olympic men's hockey gold-medal game</h2>\n<p><photo6></p>\n\n\n<p>This one's a doozy.

  "<p>MIAMI -- The dream matchup of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> pitching to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> could become reality Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Ohtani plans to hit and pitch in the finals of the World Baseball Classic against Team USA, he said after spearheading <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35907788/japan-plates-2-ninth-downs-mexico-world-baseball-classic\">Japan's rollicking 6-5 come-from-behind semifinal win against Mexico</a> on Monday night, though his time on the mound will come in an unfamiliar role: as a relief pitcher.</p>\n<p>The last time Ohtani pitched out of the bullpen was in 2016, when he was 22 years old and in the postseason with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Ohtani threw one blemish-free inning and unleashed a pair of fastballs clocked at 165 kilometers per hour -- approximately 102.5 mph, harder than any pitch he has thrown in his five seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>.</p>\n<p>Ohtani last started five days ago, throwing 71 pitches in Samurai Japan's quarterfinal victory against Italy. Never since he arrived in Major League Baseball has Ohtani thrown on four or fewer days of rest, putting him in a position to follow Japan's starter, left-hander Shota Imanaga, as well as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32055/yu-darvish\">Yu Darvish</a>, who is expected to throw in the middle innings.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>All of it sets up the possibility of Ohtani standing 60 feet, 6 inches from his friend and teammate Trout, the captain of the powerful <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35900965/turner-goldschmidt-power-team-usa-cuba-wbc-final\">U.S. team that trounced Cuba 14-2 in the semifinals</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Not only Mike Trout, but one through nine in that order is filled with superstars, household names,\" Ohtani said. \"Just excited to face that lineup. It's a great thing for Japanese baseball.\"</p>\n<p>The game between Japan and Mexico was a great thing for any fan of the game -- taut, tense, crisp, with moment after heroic moment. Ohtani featured in the most imperative moment. Japan, which had come back from a 3-0 deficit with a three-run home run from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> outfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872598/masataka-yoshida\">Masataka Yoshida</a>, frittered away the advantage and trailed 5-4 heading into the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>Ohtani, leading off against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a> reliever <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36050/giovanny-gallegos\">Giovanny Gallegos</a>, stroked a double into right-center field. As he stood on second base, Ohtani screamed toward Japan's dugouts and raised his arms in exultation twice.</p>\n<p>\"It's been a while since I was playing in a win-or-lose game, a playoff atmosphere game,\" said Ohtani, who has not reached the postseason with the Angels. \"So obviously, we couldn't lose, and I wanted to get the guys riled up in the dugout.\"</p>\n<p>Gallegos walked Yoshida, who was lifted for pinch runner Ukyo Shuto, and proceeded to face his third straight elite hitter, Nippon Professional Baseball home run champion Munetaka Murakami. After striking out in his first three at-bats, Murakami more than atoned, smashing a 111 mph line drive off the center-field fence, scoring a rejoicing Ohtani and a sliding Shuto to set off a Japanese celebration.</p>\n<p>Without the ninth-inning heroics, Ohtani would be headed back to Arizona to finish spring training with the Angels. Instead, he'll try to replicate the results of that semifinal game in 2016. On that day, his pitching coach -- Kazuyuki Atsuzawa, currently the bullpen coach for Samurai Japan -- told Ohtani in the fifth inning that if the Fighters held a lead, he would pitch the ninth. Ohtani said he took an at-bat, went to throw in a bullpen, took another at-bat and went into the game.</p>\n<p>This time, he said, \"I will be prepared. Obviously, I'm DHing, so it's going to be hard to find that time to get hot in the bullpen.\"</p>\n<p>Ohtani figures he'll manage. Just being in the finals, in meaningful games, is an experience worth cherishing.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously, it's a big accomplishment to get to the championship series, but there's a huge difference from being in first and second,\" Ohtani said, \"so I'm going to do all I can to get that first place.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>PHOENIX -- Team USA advanced to the quarterfinals of the World Baseball Classic with a 3-2 win over Colombia on Wednesday, tying Mexico for top honors in Pool C.</p>\n<p>The United States will play Venezuela in Miami on Saturday after the latter won its bracket with a 4-0 record.</p>\n<p>Team USA was led by stars <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> in the clinching victory. They combined to go 5-for-8, with Betts scoring twice and Trout driving in all three runs.</p>\n<p>Both shook off any spring rust to propel their team to the next round.</p>\n<p>\"I just think he's one of the best players of all time,\" Team USA manager Mark DeRosa said of Trout afterward. \"He's just super confident in what he's able to do. Just a big moment for him.\"</p>\n<p>Trout is the first U.S. player to have a three-hit, three-RBI game since DeRosa did it against Venezuela in 2009, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Both Trout and Betts expressed how much fun they are having playing for Team USA, indicating the injury risk is worth the reward.</p>\n<p>\"This is the [most fun] experience I've had in baseball, to represent your country,\" Trout said. \"It's been a blast. Being part of this atmosphere means a lot to me. I knew going in it was going to be a fun time. I never knew it was going to be this fun.\"</p>\n<p>As Betts added, \"This is way better than getting four at-bats on the back fields.\"</p>\n<p>The U.S. needed to win or essentially lose to Colombia by three or fewer runs to advance. The Americans were down 2-1 after three innings but erased that deficit when Trout singled home two runs in the fifth.</p>\n<p>Six relievers followed U.S. starter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32968/merrill-kelly\">Merrill Kelly</a>, who pitched three innings, giving up four hits and the two runs.

You can sit up all night and script and plan it. They have to execute.\"</p>\n<p>Both Mexico and the U.S. went 3-1 in pool play, but Mexico emerged as the higher seed by virtue of beating Team USA on Sunday. Mexico will play Puerto Rico in another quarterfinal matchup on Friday.</p>\n<p>The U.S. beat Great Britain, Canada and Colombia in Round 1.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/world-baseball-classic/\">World Baseball Classic</a> is back after a six-year absence -- it was originally scheduled for 2021 but postponed because of COVID-19 -- and the 2023 version will be bigger and better than ever, featuring more teams and star-studded rosters.</p>\n<p>The field expands from 16 to 20 teams, including first-time participants Great Britain, Nicaragua and the Czech Republic. While the British roster is mostly American-born and Bahamian natives, the Czech team is almost entirely Czech natives who have jobs outside of baseball -- like the high school geography teacher who moonlights as the team's center fielder.</p>\n<p>Teams are split up into four pools of five teams, with round-robin games in Taichung, Taiwan; Tokyo; Phoenix; and Miami. The top two teams in each pool advance to a single-elimination bracket of eight. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story?id=35768551&_slug_=world-baseball-classic-ranking-usa-dominican-republic-puerto-rico\">The Dominican Republic and United States are the two favorites</a>, and while social media has marveled at the potential Dominican lineup, the U.S. lineup looks just as powerful. The U.S. is the defending champ, although <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32815/marcus-stroman\">Marcus Stroman</a>, the 2017 WBC MVP, will be pitching for Puerto Rico this time around.</p>\n<p>Let's rank the top 50 players participating in this year's WBC. Instead of an arbitrary ranking, I've created a WAR score -- an average of each player's 2022 WAR total from Baseball-Reference and FanGraphs, plus his projected WAR from the ZiPS and Steamer projection systems. For the top international players, we'll make a subjective assessment. The No. 1 player? That was an easy call.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, DH/RHP, Japan</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 8.6</p>\n<p>This will be Ohtani's first appearance in the WBC after he missed the 2017 tournament with an ankle injury. It remains to be seen how Japan will deploy him, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> general manager Perry Minasian confirmed the team has placed no restrictions on Ohtani's usage. Ohtani had said in October that maybe he could \"pitch as a middle reliever or closer\" and the Japanese team is certainly deep in starting pitching. Ohtani made one spring training start for the Angels before pool play action.</p>\n\n\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31261/nolan-arenado\">Nolan Arenado</a>, 3B, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 6.65</p>\n<p>Arenado is coming off perhaps his best major league season in which he posted career highs in OPS+ and bWAR, hit .293/.358/.533, won his 10th consecutive Gold Glove Award and finished third in National League MVP voting. At this point, the question isn't whether he's on a Hall of Fame path, but how high he'll eventually rank among the best third basemen ever. Arenado struggled in the 2017 WBC, hitting .161 in eight games.</p>\n\n\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, CF, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 6.35</p>\n<p>Trout is finally playing in his first WBC. Maybe he wants to know what it's like playing for a winning team. The injuries have been the only thing to slow him in recent seasons -- a torn thumb ligament in 2017, wrist inflammation in 2018, foot surgery in 2019, the calf injury that cost him all but 36 games in 2021 and the back condition that limited him to 119 games in 2022. He still managed to hit 40 home runs, however, finished eighth in the MVP voting and his WAR projections remain high for 2023.</p>\n\n\n<h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a>, RF, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 6.2</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Another first-time participant, Betts is coming off a season in which he hit 35 home runs and led the NL in runs scored (the third time he has led his league). I'll be curious to see what kind of adjustments Betts makes in 2023. He's coming off the worst strikeout-to-walk ratio of his career, with his lowest walk rate since 2016 and his highest strikeout rate (which was still well below league average). It's clear Betts had a more aggressive approach in 2022, swinging at the first pitch 30.4% of the time compared to his career norm of 17.5%. That approach didn't really affect his overall results and, indeed, his power numbers were up from 2021, so maybe he sticks with it.</p>\n\n\n<h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31097/manny-machado\">Manny Machado</a>, 3B, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 6.025</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32801/jose-ramirez\">Jose Ramirez</a> isn't playing, so that least saves Dominican manager Rodney Linares from the headache of choosing between Machado, Ramirez <em>or</em> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33859/rafael-devers\">Rafael Devers</a> as his third baseman. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>. is now <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35782759/vladimir-guerrero-jr-miss-wbc-knee-inflammation\">out with knee inflammation</a>, but even without Ramirez and Guerrero, the Dominican lineup is imposing.

Based on 2022 numbers, it's not even close: The U.S. lineup is better. If you want another lefty hitter in there, find a spot for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33712/kyle-schwarber\">Kyle Schwarber</a> and his 46 home runs.</p>\n\n\n<h2>7. Julio Rodriguez, CF, Dominican Republic</h2>\n<h2></h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.775</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>I'll go out on a very short limb and predict Rodriguez will exceed that WAR score. Remember, he started off slow, hitting .206 with no home runs in April, and he also missed 30 games with injuries. He still became just the third rookie to post a 25-home run, 25-stolen base season and he hit .303/.361/.576 in the second half, which establishes a reasonable bar for what he might do in 2023. You might want to grab some of those Topps <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=julio+rodriguez+topps+espn&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS942US942&oq=julio+rodriguez+topps+espn&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.6969j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">baseball cards</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h2>8. Juan Soto, OF, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.75</p>\n<p>Soto's score is dragged down by a low 3.8 WAR from FanGraphs for his 2022 season -- a full two wins below the 5.8 Baseball-Reference valued him and certainly one of the bigger spreads you'll find among position players. Soto's power disappeared after his trade to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> and his batting average fell from .313 in 2021 to .242. Still, he posted a .401 OBP. The rankings make for an interesting debate: Would you take Rodriguez's power/speed/defense skill set over Soto's supreme ability to get on base?</p>\n\n\n<h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor\">Francisco Lindor</a>, SS, Puerto Rico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.7</p>\n<p>After a difficult first season with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> in 2021, Lindor rediscovered his mojo and hit .270/.339/.449 with 26 home runs in 2022. His WAR was helped by his durability as he missed just one game. Puerto Rico was the surprise runner-up in both 2013 and 2017, although it will be without <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a> (he and his wife are awaiting the birth of their child in early March). The Puerto Rico game plan: Scratch out a lead and then hand the ball in the late innings to the Diaz brothers, Alexis and Edwin.</p>\n\n\n<h2>10. Trea Turner, SS, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.675</p>\n<p>If you just <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/35190308/mlb-free-agency-grades-trea-turner-philadelphia-phillies\">signed a $300 million contract</a>, you better rank high on a list like this one. Turner has hit .311 over the past four seasons, is second in the majors in hits since 2018 behind only the next player on this list and remains one of the most efficient base stealers in the majors, going 27-for-30 last season. He has enough pop to hit anywhere in the lineup, but I suspect he'll be in the leadoff spot for the U.S.</p>\n\n\n<h2>11. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30193/freddie-freeman\">Freddie Freeman</a>, 1B, Canada</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.65</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>As he did in 2017, Freeman will suit up for Canada, in honor of his late mother. Freeman was born in California, but both his parents are Canadian and Freeman holds dual citizenship (in general, the WBC rules are much more lenient than the World Cup or the Olympics). Freeman leads the majors in hits since 2018 and has led the NL in runs the past three seasons (tied with Betts in 2022). After finishing seventh in NL MVP voting, he now has seven top-10 finishes and has 2.90 MVP award shares -- more than Roberto Clemente, Johnny Bench or Derek Jeter. As for Canada's chances in this tournament ... well, they went 0-3 and were outscored 21-3 in 2017. Freeman and Tyler O'Neill will have to carry the offense.</p>\n\n\n<h2>12. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37729/andres-gimenez\">Andres Gimenez</a>, 2B, Venezuela</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.55</p>\n<p>Maybe our first surprise on the list, but Gimenez had an outstanding, underrated 2022, doing a lot of little things that add up: He hit for average (.297), hit for some power (17 home runs, 46 extra-base hits), got hit by a league-leading 25 pitches to boost his OBP (.371) and played outstanding defense at second base (won a Gold Glove). Or maybe it wasn't underrated: He finished sixth in the MVP voting, which I did feel was a little high since he didn't score (66) or drive in a ton of runs (69) -- though, that was in part because he hit lower in the lineup for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a>. With both <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31662/jose-altuve\">Jose Altuve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33804/gleyber-torres\">Gleyber Torres</a> on the roster, Gimenez might slide over to shortstop for the tournament.</p>\n\n\n<h2>13. J.T. Realmuto, C, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.525</p>\n<p>Somehow, Realmuto wasn't even an NL All-Star last year -- he had a so-so first half and then exploded in the second half when he hit .307 and slugged .583. He is entering his age-32 season and with catchers, this is around when you start worrying about their workloads, especially one who plays as much as Realmuto (he started 130 games last season, plus 17 postseason games). He's such a good athlete it could be less of a concern, especially since his secondary skills remain strong -- going 21-for-22 stealing bases and throwing out a league-leading 44% of base stealers last season. He'll split catching duties for the U.S. with another player ranked a few spots lower on this list.</p>\n\n\n<h2>14. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35241/sandy-alcantara\">Sandy Alcantara</a>, P, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.35</p>\n<p>Subjectively, I would move him up a few slots based on what he did in his impressive Cy Young-winning season. But his ZiPS and Steamer projections are, umm, a little conservative at just 3.8 and 3.9 WAR. That's in part because Alcantara averaged a somewhat pedestrian 8.1 strikeout per nine innings while other elite starters average more than one K per inning. It doesn't matter in his case though, because his high 90s sinker induces so much weak contact on the ground. The Dominican team will roll out Alcantara, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41261/cristian-javier\">Cristian Javier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28955/johnny-cueto\">Johnny Cueto</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40967/roansy-contreras\">Roansy Contreras</a> along with a deep, hard-throwing bullpen that includes the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> trio of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32631/rafael-montero\">Rafael Montero</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41208/bryan-abreu\">Bryan Abreu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32377/hector-neris\">Hector Neris</a>. There's a reason this team is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35768551/world-baseball-classic-ranking-usa-dominican-republic-puerto-rico\">No. 1 in our WBC Power Rankings</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h2>15. Jose Altuve, 2B, Venezuela</h2>\n\n\n<p>Venezuela has had some disappointing tournaments, going 0-3 in the second round in 2017, failing to make it out of the first round in 2013 and never having reached the semifinals. This looks like the country's best team, however, especially on the pitching side. We'll get to that later, but with Altuve leading the way, here's a possible lineup with 2022 wRC+:</p>\n<p>CF <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36185/ronald-acuna-jr\">Ronald Acuna Jr</a>.: 114<br>\n1B <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39572/luis-arraez\">Luis Arraez</a>: 131<br>\nDH Jose Altuve: 164<br>\n3B <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a>: 131<br>\nRF <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36084/anthony-santander\">Anthony Santander</a>: 120<br>\nSS Andres Gimenez: 140<br>\nC <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31127/salvador-perez\">Salvador Perez</a>: 108<br>\n2B Gleyber Torres: 115<br>\nLF <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33384/david-peralta\">David Peralta</a>: 104</p>\n<p>That's an average wRC+ of 125 ... not too far behind the Dominican Republic. This is going to be fun.</p>\n\n\n<h2>16. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31606/xander-bogaerts\">Xander Bogaerts</a>, SS, Netherlands</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.25</p>\n<p>Bogaerts' projections of 4.6 and 4.5 WAR are well below his 2022 totals of 5.8 and 6.1. One thing to watch as he moves to the Padres: He hit .312 with an .872 OPS at Fenway and .271 with a .758 OPS on the road. On paper, the Netherlands doesn't appear to have the firepower or depth of the favorites, but it reached the semifinals in both 2013 and 2017 and its pool group -- with Chinese Taipei, Cuba, Italy and Panama -- is the weakest of the four.</p>\n\n\n<h2>17. Kyle Tucker, OF, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.0</p>\n<p>Tucker's batting average fell from .294 to .257 last season, but he still hit 30 home runs, drove in 107 runs, stole 25 bases, struck out fewer than 100 times and won a Gold Glove. He is a really underrated player and I think he's primed for a top-10 American League MVP kind of season. In the WBC, Tucker will share outfield duties with Trout, Betts, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35578/cedric-mullins\">Cedric Mullins</a> and Kyle Schwarber.</p>\n\n\n<h2>17. (tie) <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39907/tommy-edman\">Tommy Edman</a>, IF, Korea</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 5.0</p>\n<p>Born in Michigan and raised in San Diego, Edman is of Korean descent on his mother's side so he'll suit up for Korea. This team includes Padres infielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4089862/ha-seong-kim\">Ha-Seong Kim</a>, so Korea has a terrific up-the-middle pair. Subjectively, I wouldn't rate Edman this high, because his WAR in 2022 was boosted by excellent defensive metrics and he tailed off at the plate after a hot start.</p>\n\n\n<h2>19. Rafael Devers, 3B, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 4.725</p>\n<p>Case in point: I'm pretty sure Edman is never going to receive a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/35379646/what-make-rafael-devers-extension-red-sox\">$313.5 million contract extension</a> like Devers just received.</p>\n\n\n<h2>19. (tie) Jeff McNeil, 2B, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 4.725</p>\n<p>Speaking of contract extensions, McNeil's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35539926/sources-mets-batting-champ-jeff-mcneil-reach-50m-extension\">five-year deal</a> with the Mets (including a 2027 team option) will pay him $63.75 million. You might be wondering how, if WAR values Devers and McNeil similarly, the contracts can be so different. The answer: McNeil is five years older, so he's already entering his age-31 season. Still, he's coming off a batting title and has hit .300 in four of his five major league seasons.</p>\n\n\n<h2>21. Willy Adames, SS, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 4.4</p>\n<p>Adames is one of those players who would be a top-10 MVP candidate if he could consolidate all of the good things he does into a single season. He hit 31 home runs in 2022 and had his best defensive season, but his batting average and OBP dropped from 2021. There will probably always be volatility in his offensive game because of the strikeouts, but his power/defense combo is valuable and he's in the middle of his prime years.</p>\n\n\n<h2>22. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38309/will-smith\">Will Smith</a>, C, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 4.325</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> have a history of good catchers: Roy Campanella in the 1950s, Johnny Roseboro in the 1960s, Steve Yeager and Joe Ferguson in the 1970s, Mike Scioscia in the 1980s, Mike Piazza in the 1990s, Paul Lo Duca and Russell Martin in the 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30950/yasmani-grandal\">Yasmani Grandal</a> in the late 2010s and now Smith. That's quite a run (and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41234/diego-cartaya\">Diego Cartaya</a> is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/35490487/top-100-mlb-prospects-list-2023-kiley-mcdaniel\">one of the top prospects in the minors</a>).</p>\n\n\n<h2>23. Pete Alonso, 1B, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 4.2</p>\n<p>Alonso is about as safe a projection as you will find. He posted 4.4 and 4.0 WAR in 2022, 4.2 and 3.3 (FanGraphs) in 2021 and has projections of 4.4 and 4.0 for 2023. He's durable, he's going to hit home runs, he's not going to see wide swings in his defensive value and he's right in his prime at age 28.</p>\n\n\n<h2>24. Ronald Acuna Jr., OF, Venezuela</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 4.025</p>\n<p>I'll take the over, thank you very much. Acuna's WAR score is held down by time missed after 2021's knee surgery combined with a lack of power compared to his career norms. Based only on the two 2023 projections, he would rank eighth -- above Lindor, Machado and Freeman, among others -- so the computers expect his power to return. If it does, he'll return to being one of the best all-around players in the game.</p>\n\n\n<h2>25. Munetaka Murakami, 3B, Japan</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: N/A</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>In his age-22 season, Murakami had one of the greatest offensive seasons in NPB history, hitting .318/.458/.711 and setting a record for a Japanese-born player with 56 home runs. Did we mention he was 22? And that he signed a three-year extension with Yakult and will then be posted to the majors after the 2025 season? I ranked the slugging prodigy behind Alonso since he compares to him (other than that he hits left-handed).</p>\n<p>By all accounts he's not a third baseman, so when he comes to the U.S., he likely moves to first base or the outfield. There are also reports that the advanced metrics out of Japan point to a high swing-and-miss rate at pitches in the strike zone, which could be exploited against the deeper pitching staff in MLB (he fanned 128 times while drawing 93 unintentional walks). For now, he looks like one of the best hitters in the world and is certainly one of the more interesting players to watch in the tournament.</p>\n\n\n<h2>26. Wander Franco, SS, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.85</p>\n<p>Don't sell those rookie cards just yet. Yes, his sophomore season was mildly disappointing as he hit .277 and played in just 83 games, but he still looks like a future batting champ because of his elite contact skills -- oh, and he's just entering his age-22 season. He has hit 13 home runs in 153 career games, so we're still waiting for the power to develop but I could see him churning out a decade's worth of .320 average, 20-home run seasons.</p>\n\n\n<h2>27. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33223/julio-urias\">Julio Urias</a>, P, Mexico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.725</p>\n<p>Urias is 37-10 with a 2.57 ERA over the past two seasons, but the projection systems don't forecast the same kind of success, with ZiPS projecting a 3.19 ERA and Steamer a 4.04 ERA. Urias' strikeout rates aren't super elite, so that's one reason the systems don't see him as an ace, but like Alcantara, he gets a lot of soft contact. Mexico's roster certainly isn't as star-studded as some of the big boys, but a sneaky good pitching staff with Urias, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40975/patrick-sandoval\">Patrick Sandoval</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31864/taijuan-walker\">Taijuan Walker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35759/jose-urquidy\">Jose Urquidy</a> and Giovanny Gallegos could set up Mexico as the tournament's sleeper team.</p>\n\n\n<h2>28. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, P, Japan</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: N/A</p>\n<p>Winner of the Sawamura Award the past two seasons -- the Japanese version of the Cy Young Award -- Yamamoto should line up as the ace of the Japanese staff, even ahead of Ohtani and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32055/yu-darvish\">Yu Darvish</a>. He went 15-5 with a 1.68 ERA, 205 strikeouts in 193 innings and just six home runs allowed. Oh, and in case you're interested: He's just 24, will reportedly be posted to MLB by the Orix Buffaloes after the season and sits in the mid-90s with a plus-plus splitter and curveball. Scouts regard him as better than <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4142421/kodai-senga\">Kodai Senga</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35229266/senga-mets-agree-5-year-75-million-contract-sources-say\">signed a five-year, $75 million deal</a> with the Mets (he's not playing in the WBC) and this ranking might definitely be too low.</p>\n\n\n<h2>29. Luis Arraez, IF, Venezuela</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.7</p>\n<p>Now with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a>, he's coming off a batting title with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a> -- however, his .316 mark was the lowest average for a champ since Tony Gwynn's .313 in 1988.</p>\n\n\n<h2>30. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35394/edwin-diaz\">Edwin Diaz</a>, P, Puerto Rico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 2.475</p>\n<p>OK, I'm breaking the rules here and moving Diaz up into the top 50. If we stuck to raw WAR, Diaz would have just missed, which doesn't feel right for a player who re-signed with the Mets on a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34988848/edwin-diaz-finalizes-5-year-102m-deal-new-york-mets\">five-year, $102 million contract</a> following one of the most dominant relief seasons in history.</p>\n\n\n<h2>31. Ha-Seong Kim, IF, Korea</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.675</p>\n<p>Kim's score received a boost from a 5.1 WAR via Baseball-Reference, which liked his defense at shortstop for the Padres. The projection systems see him more as a 3-win player, which feels a little more accurate given his .251/.325/.383 batting line.</p>\n\n\n<h2>32. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872598/masataka-yoshida\">Masataka Yoshida</a>, OF, Japan</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.6</p>\n<p>That WAR score is based on only his two projections. The second-best hitter in Japan in 2022, Yoshida hit .336/.449/.559 and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> are buying big time into his on-base skills after giving him a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35206077/sources-red-sox-masataka-yoshida-agree-5-year-deal\">five-year, $90 million contract</a>. The deal was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/35211926/mlb-free-agency-masataka-yoshida-red-sox-contract\">met with some surprise across the sport</a> for a player limited to left field and whose power (21 home runs in Japan) might not translate to MLB, but the Red Sox see a leadoff hitter who will score 100 runs.</p>\n\n\n<h2>33. Cedric Mullins, CF, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.575</p>\n<p>He didn't match his 30-30 season from 2021 as his home runs fell from 30 to 16 -- probably more a result of the ball than anything, as he did hit a lot of fence-scrapers in 2021. He'll be second string to Trout in center field.</p>\n\n\n<h2>34. Yu Darvish, P, Japan</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.55</p>\n<p>Japan won the first World Baseball Classics in 2006 and 2009 and it's a huge, huge deal over there. Japan is the only team to reach all four semifinals, but the third-place finishes in the past two tournaments won't fly. Darvish is appearing in his second WBC, but his first since 2009, when he was the winning pitcher in the championship game against Korea.</p>\n\n\n<h2>35. Jeremy Pena, SS, Dominican Republic</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.475</p>\n<p>Coming off his outstanding rookie season with the Astros, when he won MVP honors in the ALCS and World Series, Pena will battle Adames, Franco, Marte and Segura for playing time at shortstop and second base.</p>\n\n\n<h2>36. Roki Sasaki, P, Japan</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: N/A</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Sasaki made headlines last season for the Chiba Lotte Marines when he nearly threw back-to-back perfect games at age 20; he threw one and then was pulled after eight perfect innings and 102 pitches in his next start (former major leaguer Tadahito Iguchi was the manager who had to make the painful decision). In the perfect game, he fanned an NPB record 19 batters and set another mark with 13 consecutive K's (the MLB record is 10 in a row). The 6-2 right-hander touches 100 mph, owns a whiff-inducing splitter and finished the season with a 2.02 ERA and 173 strikeouts and 23 walks in 129⅓ innings. He still needs to fine-tune his slider and scouts worry about his violent delivery and heavy workload as an amateur, but he's already one of the best pitchers in Japan.</p>\n\n\n<h2>37. Gleyber Torres, 2B, Venezuela</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.35</p>\n<p>Torres' 2019 season was so impressive -- 38 home runs at age 22 -- and his 2020 and 2021 seasons so disappointing that it's easy to gloss over that he had a solid 2022. He's not the star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> fans once envisioned and he frustrates at times, but I think the Yankees were smart not to trade him until they're sure they have somebody better.</p>\n\n\n<h2>38. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41172/brady-singer\">Brady Singer</a>, P, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.25</p>\n<p>I guess this arguably makes Singer the ace of the U.S. staff, although let's see who Mark DeRosa and pitching coach Andy Pettitte rely on for the big games with veterans like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5403/adam-wainwright\">Adam Wainwright</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32116/miles-mikolas\">Miles Mikolas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32968/merrill-kelly\">Merrill Kelly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30820/lance-lynn\">Lance Lynn</a> around -- plus a bullpen that includes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33224/devin-williams\">Devin Williams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33072/ryan-pressly\">Ryan Pressly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30158/daniel-bard\">Daniel Bard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38303/david-bednar\">David Bednar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32145/jason-adam\">Jason Adam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32005/brooks-raley\">Brooks Raley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/29705/adam-ottavino\">Adam Ottavino</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h2>38. (tie) Eugenio Suarez, 3B, Venezuela</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.25</p>\n<p>After struggling to hit for average with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a> in 2020 and 2021, Suarez was essentially a salary dump throw-in to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32833/jesse-winker\">Jesse Winker</a> trade. Instead, Winker struggled and Suarez had a very good season with 31 home runs and a 129 OPS+. The projections forecast regression, but Suarez is second in the majors in home runs since 2018, just four behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h2>40. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39631/luis-robert\">Luis Robert</a>, CF, Cuba</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.15</p>\n<p>For the first time, Cuba, the runner-up in the first WBC, is allowing major and minor leaguers who defected to play for the team -- although most of the best major leaguers, including <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36018/yordan-alvarez\">Yordan Alvarez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33095/jose-abreu\">Jose Abreu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36040/lourdes-gurriel-jr\">Lourdes Gurriel Jr</a>. and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33481/yandy-diaz\">Yandy Diaz</a>, will not be playing.

(tie) Patrick Sandoval, P, Mexico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 3.15</p>\n<p>The lefty starter had an under-the-radar season for the Angels, posting a 2.91 ERA/3.09 FIP over 27 starts.

He averaged just 7.7 K's per nine and his previous track record -- his only other season with an ERA under 4.00 came back in 2013 -- suggests some regression is likely.</p>\n\n\n<h2>43. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36488/randy-arozarena\">Randy Arozarena</a>, OF, Mexico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 2.975</p>\n<p>We know Arozarena loves the big moments: Think back to the 2020 postseason when he crushed 10 home runs in 20 games for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a>. Arozarena is a Cuba native but lived in Mexico after defecting and became a Mexican citizen last year.</p>\n\n\n<h2>44. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35383/luis-urias\">Luis Urias</a>, IF, Mexico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 2.875</p>\n<p>While the Mexico lineup lacks the firepower of the U.S. or Dominican squads, it is certainly good enough to pull off some upsets and make a run if the pitching comes through. Besides Arozarena and Urias, the roster features major leaguers Isaac Paredes, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34287/rowdy-tellez\">Rowdy Tellez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33786/alex-verdugo\">Alex Verdugo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41215/alek-thomas\">Alek Thomas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32856/austin-barnes\">Austin Barnes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34534/joey-meneses\">Joey Meneses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40810/jonathan-aranda\">Jonathan Aranda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41610/jarren-duran\">Jarren Duran</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h2>44.

The Astros should ramp up his workload from last year's 148 innings and that could make him a sleeper Cy Young contender. In other words, I would rank him much higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>46. Kyle Schwarber, LF, United States</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 2.725</p>\n<p>Coming off his NL-leading 46 home runs, Schwarber could see some action at DH and left field, especially since the U.S. lineup leans right-handed otherwise.</p>\n\n\n<h2>47.

His .342 career average is the highest in KBO history for players with at least 3,000 plate appearances. He's also just 24 and his team, the Kiwoom Heroes, has said that he will be posted to MLB after the 2023 season, making him an intriguing international free agent next offseason. As a comparison, his KBO numbers surpass those of Ha-Seong Kim, although scouts wonder how he'll hit against the better velocity he'll see in MLB. He has also one of the best nicknames of all time: Grandson of the Wind, a play off his father, KBO legend Jong-beom Lee, who was nicknamed Son of the Wind.</p>\n\n\n<h2>48. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39706/isaac-paredes\">Isaac Paredes</a>, IF, Mexico</h2>\n\n\n<p>WAR score: 2.65</p>\n<p>In 2022, his first full season with the Rays, Paredes hit just .205 -- but with 20 home runs in 331 at-bats and a good walk rate, he ended up with a 114 OPS+ while starting games at third, second and first. I wouldn't take him over some of the \"just missed\" guys below, but he's still just 24.

  "<p>TEMPE, Ariz. -- The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> will probably spend most of these next nine months doing everything they can to convince <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> he should remain with them long-term -- and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> plans to help.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to do whatever I can to keep Shohei here,\" Trout said Wednesday morning, moments before the Angels' first workout of the spring.</p>\n<p>The start of spring training also marks the beginning of Ohtani's final season before possibly becoming one of the most sought-after free agents in baseball history. By the time he hits free agency in November, he'll be a 29-year-old two-way star, offering prospective suitors an unprecedented skill set. The industry expectation is that he'll command the largest contract in baseball history, reaching and perhaps exceeding $500 million.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> figure to be at the forefront of the sweepstakes, but the Angels believe they have a shot.</p>\n<p>And they can point to Trout as an example.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>It wasn't long ago that similar questions surrounded Trout about whether a transcendent star would be willing to remain with a franchise that hasn't won enough, and ultimately he signed two extensions to remain with the Angels because of his comfort level with both the organization and its location.</p>\n<p>\"The biggest thing is he's got to do what's right for him, and what he feels right,\" Trout said when asked what advice he'd give Ohtani for how to navigate this portion of his career. \"That's all up to him. If he feels that staying in Anaheim is the right move, he should do that. And if he thinks otherwise, I'm going to do whatever I can to try to convince him to stay.</p>\n<p>\"He's got to really sit down and think about it. It's a big decision for him. It's probably the biggest one of his life. It's a difficult decision, because it's for him. If he does stay or if he -- I don't even like saying it -- if he leaves, it's going to be different for him. New atmosphere, new people, new teammates. Like I said, I'm going to do whatever I can to keep him here.\"</p>\n<p>But the biggest sell, Trout admitted, would be the Angels convincing him that they can win around him. The Angels have made only one postseason appearance over the past 13 years and haven't finished with a winning record since 2015.</p>\n<p>In an effort to correct that, the Angels made several moves to essentially address the middle of their roster, adding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33205/hunter-renfroe\">Hunter Renfroe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32269/brandon-drury\">Brandon Drury</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32721/gio-urshela\">Gio Urshela</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32151/tyler-anderson\">Tyler Anderson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34861/carlos-estevez\">Carlos Estevez</a> while placing the payroll above $200 million. Trout, perpetually optimistic, said the Angels are \"definitely a lot better than we were last year.\" But they also reside in the same division as the defending champion <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a>, with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a> also acting as major threats.</p>\n<p>If the Angels hope to keep Ohtani, they'll probably have to overcome all of that.</p>\n<p>\"That's another reason to get that winning and get to the playoffs,\" Trout said. \"That'll make a difference, for sure. It'll definitely put it in the back of Shohei's mind that we're here to compete.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

He has a job and that's the first step. You might have seen <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717803/hunter-brown\">Hunter Brown</a> throwing smoke in relief for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> this past postseason, but as a starter in Triple-A, he had a 2.55 ERA with 134 K's in 106 innings.

For this category, it's a guess on which top prospects are most likely to be on the big league roster for most of next season. Henderson, rated as baseball's top prospect in some quarters, already looked more than ready for the majors during his late-season call-up while Baltimore was fighting for a postseason bid. He's got to be the favorite.</p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>Henderson feels like the obvious pick here after a terrific minor league season and strong showing down the stretch in the majors. His plate discipline bodes well for a smooth transition in his first full season. Two potential issues that could keep him from winning: (1) what position he ends up at and how good his defense is; and (2) his ability to hit left-handers, after hitting just .208/.316/.354 across the minors and majors in 2022 (including 3-for-23 in the majors). I don't think the Orioles sit him regularly against lefties, but they could sit him against some of the better lefties, and that would cut into his overall playing time a bit.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><strong>NL Rookie of the Year</strong></h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><strong>The favorites: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41253/francisco-alvarez\">Francisco Alvarez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> (No. 4); <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42414/brett-baty\">Brett Baty</a>, Mets (No. 37); <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42404/corbin-carroll\">Corbin Carroll</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> (No. 1); <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4905919/ezequiel-tovar\">Ezequiel Tovar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a> (No. 40); <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42453/miguel-vargas\">Miguel Vargas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (No. 42); Jordan Walker, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a> (No. 5).</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepers to watch: </strong>Phillies right-hander <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872683\">Andrew Painter</a> doesn't even turn 20 until April, but he already has reached Double-A after a dominant minor league season (155 SO, 25 BB, 67 H in 103.2 IP). Don't rule out the idea of him joining the rotation early in the season.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers have pitchers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4326703\">Bobby Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4417230\">Gavin Stone</a>, both of whom could factor into the rotation. Stone soared through three levels of the minors with a 1.48 ERA and 168 K's in 121 2/3 IP. Cardinals outfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4345070/alec-burleson\">Alec Burleson</a> hit .331 with 20 home runs at Triple-A; he's at least a DH candidate. Reds shortstop <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4917694/elly-de-la-cruz\">Elly De La Cruz</a> is likely ticketed for more time in the minors, but he's one of the top prospects there (.304, 28 HRs, 47 SBs in 2022, mostly in High A). -- <em>Schoenfield</em></p>\n<p><strong>And our picks are ... </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Doolittle:</strong> Maybe it's my sense of New York-related hype from my Midwestern perch, but it seems to me that if Alvarez can simply win the job as the Mets' regular catcher in spring training, he has to be the favorite. He's such a good hitter that he should get plenty of time at DH when he's not behind the plate. That'll be tough to beat.</p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>Carroll has the pedigree: top pick, top prospect, performed well in the minors in 2022 despite missing nearly two full seasons of action due to COVID-19 and an injury (he hit .307 with 24 home runs and 31 steals). He also hit well in a September call-up (133 OPS+ in 32 games). The Diamondbacks have four outfielders who all hit left-handed, so we'll see how they sort things out and whether Carroll ends up in center field or left field. If he ends up in left field, he could have a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steven Kwan</a>-type rookie season, batting leadoff with Gold Glove defense (and a little more power than Kwan).</p>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"imageLoaded\" src=\"http://espn.go.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>AL Cy Young</strong></h2>\n<p><photo4></p>\n<p><strong>The favorites: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40912/shane-bieber\">Shane Bieber</a>, Guardians; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35124/luis-castillo\">Luis Castillo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34943/dylan-cease\">Dylan Cease</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32081/gerrit-cole\">Gerrit Cole</a>, Yankees; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42436/alek-manoah\">Alek Manoah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, Angels; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41199/shane-mcclanahan\">Shane McClanahan</a>, Rays; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36581/framber-valdez\">Framber Valdez</a>, Astros.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepers to watch: </strong>You saw how unhittable <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41261\">Cristian Javier</a>'s top-of-the-zone fastball can be in the postseason (batters hit .181 against it). So maybe he's not a sleeper, but give him a full season in the Astros' rotation (he pitched 148 innings in 2022 after starting the season in the bullpen) and watch out. Seattle's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42406/george-kirby\">George Kirby</a> went 8-5 with a 3.39 ERA (2.99 FIP) as a rookie. He pounds the zone, and if he can improve against left-handed hitters, that ERA could drop significantly. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32697/lucas-giolito\">Lucas Giolito</a> had a rough 2022 (4.90 ERA) for the White Sox, but he picked up down-ballot Cy Young votes in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Cleveland's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34954/triston-mckenzie\">Triston McKenzie</a> had a breakout season (2.96 ERA, 196 SO), so maybe, similar to Javier, he's no longer a sleeper. -- <em>Schoenfield</em></p>\n<p><strong>And our picks are ...</strong></p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><strong>Doolittle:</strong> If Verlander winds up back in the AL, he'll join this list. Same for fellow free agents <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32796/jacob-degrom\">Jacob deGrom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33696/carlos-rodon\">Carlos Rodon</a>. Still, I'll go with Ohtani, who I thought should have been a finalist for his 2022 performance. It just seems like destiny that he's going to win a Cy Young at some point, so next season is as good as any, especially since it's a platform season for him. Not that he needs to showcase himself to get paid, because that's going to happen no matter what.</p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>McClanahan. He was the favorite at the All-Star break when he was 10-3 with a 1.71 ERA, but his second half wasn't as dominant (4.20 ERA) and he missed a couple of weeks in September with a shoulder impingement, finishing with a 2.54 ERA. He should be able to improve upon 2022's 166 innings and get close to 200 innings to boost his case.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><strong>NL Cy Young</strong></h2>\n<p><photo5></p>\n<p><strong>The favorites: </strong>Sandy Alcantara, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39878/corbin-burnes\">Corbin Burnes</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32685/max-fried\">Max Fried</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a>; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33709/aaron-nola\">Aaron Nola</a>, Phillies; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28976/max-scherzer\">Max Scherzer</a>, Mets; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33223/julio-urias\">Julio Urias</a>, Dodgers; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31267/zack-wheeler\">Zack Wheeler</a>, Phillies.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepers to watch:</strong> Milwaukee's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37515/brandon-woodruff\">Brandon Woodruff</a> finished fifth in the 2021 voting, so he has been here before. He has morphed into more of a fly ball pitcher, which is fine unless a livelier baseball returns. If <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28963/clayton-kershaw\">Clayton Kershaw</a> can get back to 175 innings, which he last did in 2019, he might have a shot given his 2.28 ERA and .207 average allowed in 2022 with the Dodgers. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a>' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42433/nick-lodolo\">Nick Lodolo</a> is a deep sleeper. He had a 2.92 ERA over his final 13 starts as a rookie. He's in the wrong park and needs to cut down on the walks and hit batters (19!), but his curveball is already one of the best in the game.<em> -- Schoenfield</em></p>\n<p><strong>And our picks are ... </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Doolittle: </strong>Again, any and all of the Verlander/deGrom/Rodon group join this list if they sign with an NL team this offseason. With both leagues, if forced to choose between a pitcher on my favorites list and the entire field of starters, I'd pick the field. That's the nature of Cy Young prognostication. Forced to choose, however, I'll go with Fried. His dogged determination should mean continued success and perhaps even improvement, and after getting a lot of support in 2020 and 2022, it might simply be his turn if he posts another elite season. He has averaged 5.2 bWAR over the past two seasons and is adding volume to the mix as he goes along.</p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>I'm going with someone who falls in between the favorites and the sleepers here.<strong> </strong>Will Arizona's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39910/zac-gallen\">Zac Gallen</a> have another scoreless streak of 44 1/3 innings like he did last August and September? No, probably not. Since his run came late in the season, his 2.54 ERA flew under the radar, but don't be surprised if he does it again. He improved his control in 2022, he'll have a terrific outfield defense behind him to help and lefties have trouble squaring him up (.140 average last season).</p>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"imageLoaded\" src=\"http://espn.go.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>AL MVP</strong></h2>\n<p><photo6></p>\n<p><strong>The favorites: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36018/yordan-alvarez\">Yordan Alvarez</a>, Astros; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>., Blue Jays; Shohei Ohtani, Angels; Julio Rodriguez, Mariners; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42178/adley-rutschman\">Adley Rutschman</a>, Orioles; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>; Angels.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepers to watch: </strong>After a couple of years battling injuries, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34886/alex-bregman\">Alex Bregman</a> finally looked like an elite hitter again in the second half (.287/.379/.515). Teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34967/kyle-tucker\">Kyle Tucker</a> has had back-to-back 5-WAR seasons and should be in his prime at age 26.

In the non-Astros category, we can still dream that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32655/byron-buxton\">Byron Buxton</a> will have one season where he plays 145 games and posts 7.5 WAR.</p>\n<p><strong>And our picks are ...</strong></p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><strong>Doolittle:</strong> If Judge is once again a Yankee, add him to the list and maybe pencil him in at the top of it. Still, as long as Ohtani is healthy for a full season as both a hitter and a pitcher, it's hard to consider anyone else a front-runner. He's my pick, though a spirited race between super sophomores Rodriguez and Rutschman would be a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Schoenfield:</strong> Ohtani. Even if Judge re-signs with the Yankees, I'm going with Ohtani. Of course, there is one caveat here: What if the Angels are terrible and Ohtani is traded to the NL?

When he plays, though, Trout has been Trout, with no discernible sign of slippage.</p>\n<p>He's also becoming a more prolific home run hitter. Trout was already on a Hall of Fame track by the end of 2016, his fifth full season in the majors. Up to that point, he had homered in 4.7% of his plate appearances. Since then, that number has soared to 7%. Even as Trout's other skills start to erode, which is inevitable, this is the one that should be the last to go. And he's still only 30 years old.</p>\n<p>Trout is now better than break-even to join the 500-homer club. My version of the James tool also gives him a 16% shot at 600. That number would go up with a few seasons of 145 or more games strung together, and the 700-homer club would start to loom as a possibility.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The long shots: </strong>He's not a long shot since he's fourth on the list, but I'd put Manny Machado's odds well above 50%. Three things I like about his trajectory:</p>\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>He came up so young, debuting at 20 years old, that he's closing in on 300 home runs while still in his age-29 season.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>He has been remarkably durable, other than the knee injury way back in 2014, playing 153-plus games every season (except the COVID-19 season, when he didn't miss a game).\n\n\n</li>\n<li>He's consistent. While he has never had a 40-homer season, he's about to top 30 for the sixth time in eight seasons. A historical comparison might be somebody like Eddie Murray, who never hit 40 but hit 25 or more 12 times and finished with 504 home runs. I think Machado beats that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>As for players lower on the list, I'm going with Austin Riley. He had the raw power as a prospect, but he has also turned into a good all-around hitter. He might get to 40 home runs this season and is just entering his prime seasons at 25. If the ball returns to being a little more lively in upcoming seasons, I can see him cranking out a few 40-homer seasons during the rest of his 20s. And his power-plus-hitting combo means he can eventually age over to first base later in his career and put in the long career needed to reach 500.</p>\n<p><strong>Predicting the next to ... </strong></p>\n<p><strong>500 HRs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield: </em>Trout. As we've just recently seen, he's still one of the best in the game whenever he's on the field. Stanton does have more home runs now, but he's not exactly Cal Ripken Jr., either. Let's go with Trout -- maybe he gets 50 next season if he stays healthy and plays 145 games.</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>Even with Trout's injury patterns, I still don't see anyone else beating him there, especially since Cruz seems to be near the end of the line. Stanton has the same issues, only more so.</p>\n<p><strong>600 HRs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield: </em>Let's see. Say Trout finishes with 350 this year. He's signed through 2030, which is eight more seasons (his age-38 season). If he averages 30 per season, that only gets him to 560. If you throw in a couple monster seasons, I guess it's possible, but it just feels optimistic. So I'm going with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41044/julio-rodriguez\">Julio Rodriguez</a>. (Hey, I'm a Mariners fan. I can dream of 10 straight 40-homer seasons, right?)</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>Trout. If Aaron Judge were a little younger, he might be my pick. It's hard to believe that even though Trout debuted five years before Judge, Trout's only about eight months older. That being said, Sammy Sosa once put up 243 homers from his age-29 to his age-32 seasons. If Judge embarks on a spree like that, we can revisit this question.</p>\n<p><strong>700 HRs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield: </em>OK, as much as I love Julio, only three players have reached 700 (with Pujols on the horizon). The best bet remains a healthy Trout.</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>I don't think any active players will, but I'd anoint Trout as the most likely.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><strong>The 3,000-hit club</strong></h2>\n<p><inline3-wide></p>\n<p><strong>Most likely to get there: </strong>Freddie Freeman.</p>\n<p>More than anything, getting to 3,000 hits is about consistency -- consistency in staying in the lineup, consistency in getting the bat on the ball, consistency in producing hits on those balls in play. That's Freddie Freeman.</p>\n<p>This is Freeman's 12th full season in the majors. Through six full seasons, he was hitting .288 with a .342 BABIP and a 22% strikeout rate, and averaging 169 hits per 162 games played. At this point, he's at .310, with a .341 BABIP and a 17% strikeout rate, and has averaged 190 hits per 162 games. And he's durable, with this season likely to mark his fourth straight full season of 158 or more games. In the shortened 2020 season, he played in all 60 contests.</p>\n<p>Freeman will hit the 2000-hit mark during the first half of next season. Then we can start counting down.</p>\n<p><strong>The long shots:</strong> Trea Turner led the NL in hits in 2020 and 2021 and is right behind Freeman for the major league lead this season. Why are his odds still so low? For starters, he didn't play 100 games for the first time until his age-25 season, and then COVID-19 wiped out another 100 games from what would have been his best season in 2020. That's a lot to overcome -- and he'll need almost 2,000 hits in his 30s to get there. But keep in mind that players with speed generally age better than slow sluggers, and Turner remains as fast as anybody. I think Turner will age very well. Hey, Ichiro got 2,080 hits in his 30s, so it can be done. Of course, Ichiro also averaged 159 games per season. OK, maybe Turner hangs on to his early 40s to get there.</p>\n<p><strong>Predicting the next to ... </strong></p>\n<p><strong>3,000 hits</strong></p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield: </em>I'm going with Machado again. Which means I just predicted 500 home runs and 3,000 hits -- a club that currently includes just seven members. Machado's seasonal hit rates aren't spectacular, but he might hit .300 this season and he's closing in on 1,600 career hits. Another historical comparison here: Ripken Jr. had 1,552 hits through age-29. Yes, his durability is unmatched, but he got to 3,000 hits hitting .280 while averaging 152 hits per season in his 30s. Machado can do that.</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>Freeman. A few years ago, I would have been certain that Altuve would be the guy. And he could still get there, but his pace has slowed considerably, and as a middle infielder -- and a small one, at that -- it's hard to think Altuve will be able to match his peak seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>3,500 hits</strong></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield: </em>Frankly, unless the nature of the game changes, I don't see any active players getting there. Maybe the new rule banning the shift will help left-handed hitters and slowly improve the leaguewide batting averages. Any young lefty hitters that might be able to take advantage of that over a long career? Well, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42470/michael-harris-ii\">Michael Harris II</a> is 21 and already showing the ability to hit for average, but predicting 2,500 hits is silly enough, let alone 3,500.</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>I don't think Freeman has enough time to get there. I could see Machado doing it, but I'm not sure he'll hit for average enough. This level -- 3,500 -- is rarefied air, especially for the current era, so I'm not sure anyone active will get that close. You could see Vladimir Guerrero Jr. reel off a few 200-hit seasons and get on track, but I wouldn't want to bet on the back side of his career given his body type.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><strong>The 2,000-RBI club</strong></h2>\n<p><inline4-wide></p>\n<p><strong>Most likely to get there: </strong>Machado?</p>\n<p>Look, chances are, no active player will get there simply because 2,000 career RBIs is a very rare feat. However, I think Machado has the best combination of factors to make a run at it. He hits the ball hard, is aggressive and gets the ball in play. He just turned 30 and should play in a high-powered lineup for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Still, it's going to be an uphill battle. Everyone has something working against them. Miggy retains the highest odds, and at 1,841 RBIs, he isn't that far away in theory. But I don't see him getting there. Cabrera has said <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34353799/miguel-cabrera-detroit-tigers-clarifies-stance-future-says-return-next-season-initially-planned\">he plans to return in 2023</a> for his 21st major league season. If next season turns out to be his last, he obviously won't get to 2,000 -- and it will probably be his last.</p>\n<p><strong>The long shots:</strong> Who's asking these questions? Only five players have gotten here -- and, yes, two of them are recent players in Pujols and Alex Rodriguez. But the style of game has changed dramatically even since those two debuted. It used to be that the top two hitters were often low-power hitters with good on-base percentages. Since they weren't driving themselves in with home runs, that created many more RBI opportunities for the No. 3 and 4 hitters. These days we see Judge hitting leadoff. My long-shot guess: Julio Rodriguez. Assuming the Mariners move him out of the leadoff position next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Predicting the next to ... </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1,500 RBIs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield: </em><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31027/paul-goldschmidt\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> has raised his game to such a high level this season that we have to rethink how good he'll be in his mid-30s compared to what we might have thought a couple years ago. He's good, he's durable and he has averaged 105 RBIs over 162 games throughout his career. He's the next guy.</p>\n<p><inline5><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>While 2,000 seems unlikely, there will be some new members of the 1,500-RBI club among active players. You've got three premier hitters who are in their 30s, are still producing elite seasons and are already over 950 RBIs: Goldschmidt, Freeman and Nolan Arenado. All three have established levels of 100 or more RBIs. I could see any of them getting there first.</p>\n<p>But I'll go with Arenado. He's back to being where he was in terms of hitting for average in 2019. That could be a blip, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. When Arenado hits for average, with his pop and aggressiveness, he drives in runs. And he should continue to play in strong lineups in St. Louis.</p>\n<p><strong>2,000 RBIs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Schoenfield:</em> If Julio takes up Tom Brady's nutrition plan, marries a supermodel and starts doing Subway commercials, maybe he gets there.</p>\n<p><br>\n<em>Doolittle: </em>No active player is going to get there. Maybe it'll be Fernando Tatis III.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Four weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>' baseball operations department had come to a consensus: The team had reached an ideal window to trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>. The greatest two-way player in baseball history will be eligible for free agency in the fall of 2023, so some other teams communicated to the Angels that they would be open to trades -- and willing to include their very best prospects. The view around the industry was that the ensuing bidding might've netted a return that would be similar to what the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a> got for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a>. Maybe more, because Ohtani would've filled lineup <em>and</em> rotation holes for two pennant races before his free agency.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, despite his department's suggestion, general manager Perry Minasian didn't bother wasting everyone's time. Word quickly reached the interested parties that Arte Moreno, the Angels' owner, wouldn't sign off on any Ohtani deal. No one was surprised.</p>\n<p>It was an example of Moreno single-handedly steering his team, again -- and probably in the wrong direction, again. And maybe for the last time, because the Angels announced Tuesday afternoon that Moreno is open to offers to sell the team, including a statement from the owner that read, \"Now is the time.\"</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p>\"He's had enough,\" said one of Moreno's peers after the Angels' news broke. \"I think he's gotten frustrated with the stadium situation, he's not a big fan of [commissioner] Rob [Manfred] and he's got a s---ty team that's going to be bad for a long time.\"</p>\n<p>Moreno has long been known as a demanding boss, which is not unusual in private industry. But in this era of analytics, in which most owners are comfortable deferring to baseball operations departments, Moreno has been an outlier in how often he shoved his front-office professionals out of the way and made his own deals.</p>\n<p>He would intermittently shuttle staffers into his version of a penalty box, to the degree that job titles really didn't matter; what mattered was how much sway the managers and general managers had in that moment with Moreno. The notion of a chain of command has been little more than theory within the Angels organization, which has made it difficult for Moreno's team to keep up with baseball's more data-driven teams.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Moreno took control of the Angels in 2003, fresh off a World Series win, and for years, his title-winning manager Mike Scioscia was perceived by peers to have more practical power than any other in baseball, more than former Angels GM Tony Reagins too. But over time, as the Angels' struggles continued, Scioscia's influence waned, and he retired in 2018. By then, Billy Eppler was the GM; he convinced Ohtani to sign with the Angels and reduced the payroll mess, but his teams never reached the postseason. Against Eppler's suggestions, Moreno insisted upon the hiring of former Angels coach Joe Maddon following the 2019 season. Maddon briefly held the throne of most powerful employee, and Eppler was gone before the 2020 season was up. Earlier this year, after Maddon fell out of favor, supplanted as the favorite by Minasian, Maddon was fired and replaced by Phil Nevin. Now, the presumption among executives is that in the face of the 2022 disaster, even Minasian might be on double secret probation.</p>\n<p>Early on, the Angels were riding high off their title, and the team made the playoffs repeatedly -- in five out of Moreno's first six years in charge. It might be that this success fueled unjustified confidence in his own abilities. Like a lot of billionaires before him, Moreno seemed to believe he knew more about building a baseball team than the folks he hired. But the strengths that made him an extraordinary success before he bought the Angels became a weakness once he stepped into a sport that has become increasingly competitive.</p>\n<p>In a way that others have a weakness for ice cream, Moreno loves hitters; his forte is in marketing, and he has long conveyed to staffers that offense sells tickets. This is how it came to be that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4574/albert-pujols\">Albert Pujols</a> wound up with the Angels on a 10-year, $240 million deal, how <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/bio/_/id/4652/josh-hamilton\">Josh Hamilton</a> signed a $125 million, five-year contract, how <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/bio/_/id/28841/justin-upton\">Justin Upton</a> inked a five-year, $106 million deal, how <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a> received a staggering $245 million whopper.</p>\n<p>That's $716 million for four sluggers who, according to Fangraphs, have totaled 14.2 WAR to date (with Rendon still part of the Angels' roster). That's slightly more than <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> has generated in just 2021 and 2022.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly, Moreno dropped these bad deals on his franchise -- then wondered why his front offices couldn't work around that mess and construct a competitive roster with a top-heavy payroll.</p>\n<p>All of the Angels' recent struggles -- one playoff series since 2009, an American League Division Series sweep -- could change now under new ownership, assuming that Moreno follows through with the sale of team. There is quiet relief in a lot of the corners of the sport over the possibility that the Angels will have new ownership -- just as there was when Frank McCourt was forced to sell the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> to the Guggenheim Group, when the Wilpons sold the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> to Steve Cohen. Many executives believe that the Angels have not come close to exploiting the potential of their market. \"Because that place might be the best to work in in baseball,\" one official said. \"The weather is perfect. The conditions are perfect. You can live on the beach. Nobody bothers them. The fans are good.\"</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>The Angels' lack of postseason success has come despite fielding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, the game's preeminent player, for the past decade, and Ohtani, a historical superstar, for the past five seasons. Moreno also is regarded as increasingly out of step with other owners; in the prior labor negotiation, he was viewed as one of the most ardent labor hawks by his peers, along with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>' Ken Kendrick and Jerry Reinsdorf of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a>.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Moreno's greatest contribution to the Angels might be in how his track record will tee up the next owner as a success, by comparison -- although it won't be easy. The team's desperate need for improved infrastructure continues, and the incoming owner will have to immediately make a decision about Ohtani.</p>\n<p>If the Angels trade Ohtani this winter, they will likely receive markedly less for him than they would have last month -- and will lose out on millions in international marketing and revenue that a global superstar brings. If the new owner surrenders in the contract negotiations and gives him what would probably be a record deal, then the organization will again have to work around a top-heavy payroll, with the trio of Trout, Rendon and Ohtani likely making about $120 million annually.</p>\n<p>That's a problem that some billionaire will certainly gladly take on. But as Moreno leaves Anaheim, it's one that he could never solve -- and, more problematically, would never fully empower others to attack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

ESPN's Stephania Bell answers the biggest questions surrounding the three-time American League MVP.</p>\n<h2>What is Mike Trout's injury?</h2>\n<p>Angels athletic trainer Mike Forstad told reporters Wednesday that Trout has a \"costovertebral dysfunction at T5.\"</p>\n<p>The first hint of the problem came when Trout exited a game early on July 12, reportedly due to back spasms. He was subsequently placed on the IL with what was termed rib cage inflammation.</p>\n<p>The reality is that all three of these descriptors are interrelated.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Let's begin with the actual diagnosis of costovertebral dysfunction at T5. The \"T\" stands for thoracic which refers to the middle section of the spine. There are three primary regions within the spine with distinct articulating vertebrae: the neck (cervical spine) consisting of the top seven vertebrae, the low back (lumbar spine) consisting of the lower five vertebrae and the mid back (thoracic spine) consisting of the twelve vertebrae in the middle. Each vertebra is labeled by its position within its respective section in descending order from the head. For instance, in the thoracic spine, the vertebrae are labeled T1-T12 with T1 being the first vertebra just below the cervical spine and T12 being the last vertebra just before the lumbar spine.</p>\n<p>T5, the level referenced in Trout's injury, is the fifth thoracic vertebra. For context, it is positioned at about the level of the upper part of the shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>Compounding the anatomy in the thoracic spine, each vertebra interfaces or articulates with a rib. Those articulations form joints. The joints are very tiny yet they are similar in structure and function to any other joint in the body with cartilage covering the interfacing surfaces, capsule and ligaments around them to provide support and muscles in the area to control movement. The specific joint where a rib articulates with the body (main box-like portion) of the vertebra is called a costovertebral joint, \"costo\" for the rib and \"vertebral\" for the vertebra, and in the thoracic spine there is a joint at every level and on each side (for the left and right ribs).</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>In addition to movement properties, the costovertebral joint can be a source of pain if there is an injury. Like with other joints, trauma or overuse can result in localized pain and inflammation which can then trigger muscle spasms as a protective mechanism. Spasms are often the body's way of splinting a joint so as not to allow excess motion that could result in further injury; pain is a means of preventing that movement.</p>\n<p>Trout has indicated he's not sure how or when the injury happened, which is not uncommon, particularly in the case of a repetitive motion or overuse situation. It may have been developing for some time but finally reached a point of provoking enough pain and spasm to limit his ability to perform baseball activity. Somehow he developed an injury at this T5 costovertebral joint that now, as a result of pain, (rib cage) inflammation and (back) spasms, is not permitting normal motion. All together, the situation represents a costovertebral dysfunction at T5 with associated rib cage inflammation and back spasms.</p>\n<h2>What does an injury like this mean for a baseball player? What parts of his game would it affect?</h2>\n<p>It has the potential to affect every aspect of his game, particularly when it is in the acute stage, as pain and inflammation will limit movement in every direction. Baseball is a largely rotational sport, however, and the rotation involved in swinging a bat, throwing a ball from the outfield (no matter which side is affected, since rotation creates movement on both sides of the spine) could be particularly problematic. Diving to make a play in the outfield or to slide into a base could also be impacted given the movement associated with either of those skills. Straight line running might be less of an issue, <em>but </em>it's worth noting that breathing creates rib motion, so in the acute phase running could also be affected.</p>\n<h2>What does it mean for this season?</h2>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Trout is undergoing the treatment one would expect for any joint-related injury. He has already received a cortisone injection to help target local inflammation, and he is resting from baseball. As the inflammation settles down, he will likely gradually increase his mobility and conditioning and do very specific exercises targeted at strengthening the smaller muscles of the spine and rib cage that help control movement at the joint.</p>\n<p>Assuming he can perform those activities pain-free, he could gradually progress to baseball-specific activity, including light throwing and swinging of a bat with the ultimate goal of returning to competition. It's not possible to say how quickly and effectively he'll progress, and Forstad told reporters they were not at a point yet of making a decision regarding the rest of the season. For his part, Trout says he expects to play again this year and that certainly sounds within reason, presuming he can get his current symptoms under control.</p>\n<h2>What about for his career?</h2>\n<p>Trout was very clear the other day when he said, \"My career isn't over.\" And he's right. This should not be a career-threatening injury, at least as it's been described thus far. But it may be -- just as with any other joint injury affecting an athlete -- that he is on a maintenance program going forward that incorporates exercises designed to reinforce the strength of the muscles in that area.</p>\n<p>Could there be a future flare-up? Sure. And should that happen, the regimen would likely be very similar. It might even settle more quickly given the knowledge gained from this first episode. But there's also a chance he could go years without a flare-up. There are really no guarantees.</p>\n<h2>Is it related to the other injuries he's had in recent seasons?</h2>\n<p>It certainly doesn't seem to be, unless he's dealt with something outside of what has sent him to the IL in the past. He had a thumb ligament injury five years ago from a headfirst slide that resulted in surgery. He had a calf strain that cost him the bulk of last season. And he's had a few other odds and ends mixed in as well but, as far as we know, nothing rib or spine related.</p>\n<h2>Is this comparable to any other baseball player or athlete's injury?</h2>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Let's put it this way: Not as far as we know. Many athletes have dealt with rib injuries and many have dealt with spine injuries. Rarely do we hear an injury described with the level of specificity as Trout's. That doesn't mean another player hasn't had a costovertebral injury. In fact, it's highly likely that several players have dealt with something similar but we just may not be aware of it. It's also a credit to Trout's medical staff, including spine specialist Dr. Robert Watkins, with whom he consulted for this injury. Having people who will look for and are knowledgeable about the small details that inform the specific diagnosis can be key to a successful outcome.</p>\n<p><em><sup>*</sup>There are also five fused vertebrae below the lumbar spine that make up the sacrum, and the tailbone attaches to the bottom of the sacrum. Since they do not represent individual articulating joints, they are not included in the description above.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> will help make up the American League's All-Star Game starting lineup 30 miles from here at Dodger Stadium on July 19. They entered Tuesday within the top 10 in the majors in FanGraphs wins above replacement, trending toward potential MVP consideration.</p>\n<p>And yet the team they play for, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>, is once again pacing toward irrelevance, sitting 12 games below .500 and eight games back of the sixth and final playoff spot, with a hellish five-game stretch coming against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>.</p>\n<p>Barring a stark turnaround, the Angels are on track to miss the postseason for the 12th time in the past 13 years -- even though Trout has been arguably the sport's brightest star for 11 of those seasons and Ohtani has acted as a transformative two-way player for each of the past two. In August, Trout will turn 31. And in 16 months, Ohtani can venture into the free agent market. But Angels general manager Perry Minasian still believes this franchise can contend around its two best players.</p>\n<p>\"There's definitely a formula to win around them -- and it's a deeper team,\" Minasian said before a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/boxscore/_/gameId/401355534\">6-5 loss</a> to the Astros. \"You can do that in a lot of different ways. The draft's part of it, but free agency is part of that, trades is part of that. I definitely see a road map to putting a competitive team on the field with those guys. They're great players; they've really performed well. I think they deserve all the accolades they get daily; I'm looking forward to watching both of them in the All-Star Game.</p>\n<p>\"I think they're two of the best players in baseball, and we're lucky to have them.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The Angels surged at the start of the 2022 season, winning 27 of their first 44 games. But that was followed by a mystifying 14-game losing streak, during which Minasian fired Joe Maddon as the team's manager. The Angels haven't necessarily recovered from that, going 11-20 under interim manager Phil Nevin. The starting rotation, a focus of Minasian during the offseason, has been solid. But the offense -- minus <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a>, who underwent season-ending wrist surgery in the middle of June -- has struggled mightily, posting the second-lowest OPS in the majors over the past seven weeks despite the continued presence of Trout and Ohtani. (Trout exited Tuesday's game with upper-back spasms, but Nevin told reporters he doesn't believe the injury is serious enough to warrant an injured list stint.)</p>\n<p>\"It's on me,\" Minasian said. \"A hundred percent on me. I'm in charge of the roster. Coaches can only work with what I give 'em. I'm very cognizant of that.\"</p>\n<p>The trade market is expected to pick up after the conclusion of next week's draft, at which point teams will undoubtedly express interest in the Angels' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard\">Noah Syndergaard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33252/michael-lorenzen\">Michael Lorenzen</a> -- capable starting pitchers who are also pending free agents. Minasian opted against designating whether he would look to add veteran players or use his current veterans to build up the minor league system, saying he will \"look for opportunities to make the club better, whether that's short term or long term.\"</p>\n<p>The question circulating around the Angels is whether they would consider trading Ohtani (who is only under team control through 2023) or Trout, who is signed through 2030 and must approve of any trade. But that scenario -- if it were to even be considered -- likely wouldn't manifest itself until the offseason, when more teams can theoretically get involved.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not gonna talk about specific people,\" Minasian said when asked about trading his stars. \"Teams are gonna call and ask about everybody. If you have really good players on your team, for the most part you get called and asked about them. You don't hang up the phone, per se, but some players are harder to trade than others, obviously.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

It was the ninth cycle in franchise history and the first since <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> in 2019.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Walsh went 4-for-5 and drove in three runs. He completed the cycle with a two-run triple in the eighth inning after Mets center fielder <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40657/khalil-lee\">Khalil Lee</a> failed to make a diving catch.</p>\n<p>\"I thought about it a little bit, but I just wanted to put the barrel on the ball,\" Walsh said about coming up to the plate in the eighth. \"I was making pretty good contact, so I felt like if I got something over the plate, I might have a chance to drive it.\"</p>\n<p>Angels manager Phil Nevin said as soon as he saw Lee try to dive for the ball, he knew Walsh would complete the cycle.</p>\n<p>\"I yelled 'cycle' right when he dove,\" Nevin said. \"Cycles are more rare than a no-hitter.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- For <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33453/matt-duffy\">Matt Duffy</a>, this all felt far too familiar.</p>\n<p>It was only 11 months ago that Duffy's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> lost 11 consecutive games from late June to early July, going from nine games above .500 to a losing record. They never recovered. Now Duffy, a 31-year-old infielder, finds himself on a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> team that just concluded a 14-game losing streak that torched their blistering start. As the losses mounted and the rut endured, Duffy noticed he and his Angels teammates were navigating games in a strikingly similar fashion -- by placing excessive importance on early-inning situations, by acting like any deficit was too large to overcome, by playing as if the losing streak had consumed them entirely.</p>\n<p>\"That's been weighing [on us] for about a week now, it seems,\" Duffy said. \"It seems like every opportunity we have to score runs, or every opportunity we have to keep them off the board -- even in the fifth, I'm feeling it. It's like a playoff game. And it's the f---ing fifth inning right now. They might score, we're trying to keep them off the board, but it [shouldn't be] a pressure f---ing situation. That's how it feels.\"</p>\n<p>Duffy spoke from his locker late Wednesday night, in the middle of an Angels clubhouse that had become eerily quiet. The strobe lights that had routinely adorned the room during postgame celebrations were static. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/33886576/mike-trout-shohei-ohtani-october-six-players-help-get-los-angeles-angels-playoffs\">cowboy hat used to commemorate home runs</a> had begun collecting dust. The noticeable<strong> </strong>good vibes these Angels carried through the season's first six-plus weeks had vanished.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p>Four days earlier, on a Sunday afternoon in<strong> </strong>Philadelphia, Bryce Harper's eighth-inning grand slam seemed to send the Angels to a new low. Then <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> starter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32640/michael-wacha\">Michael Wacha</a> shut them out in Southern California on Monday night, triggering the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/34053973/inside-long-simmering-issues-led-angels-firing-joe-maddon\">surprising firing of manager Joe Maddon</a> the following morning. Later that afternoon, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> pulled a groin muscle and the Angels lost in extra innings. The following day, the Angels, clearly grasping, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34062097/the-los-angeles-angels-turned-nickelback-walk-music-try-break-their-slump\">turned to Nickelback</a> and were shut out once more, extending a franchise record with their 14th consecutive loss.</p>\n<p>In a little more than two weeks, the Angels have gone from a dominant team <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33927532/angels-dodgers-vs-mets-yankees-which-mlb-town-take-right-now-la-nyc\">with aspirations of a division title</a> to a flailing club primed to miss the postseason for the 12th time in 13 years, even at a time when the field has expanded to 12 teams.</p>\n<p>They were off to their best 44-game start in 18 years, and now -- after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>'s inspired performance in Thursday's 5-2, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34067278/shohei-ohtani-homer-pitching-gem-help-snap-los-angeles-angels-14-game-losing-streak\">streak-ending victory</a> -- they're 2 1/2 games back of the sixth and final playoff spot in the American League.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The Angels, according to research by the Elias Sports Bureau, now own the longest losing streak for a team that was at least 10 games above .500 when that streak began, surpassing a 1985 Cubs team that dropped 13 in a row. Only three teams have ever made the postseason despite a double-digit losing streak -- the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, the 1982 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a> and the 1951 New York Giants, none of whom dropped more than 11 straight.</p>\n<p>And yet the regular season is only 36% complete and the Angels are still a good week away from a winning record.</p>\n<p>It's why Perry Minasian, a general manager for the first time, acted with such urgency when he fired Maddon.</p>\n<p>\"As poorly as we've played over the last few weeks, there's an opportunity right in front of us,\" Minasian said during Tuesday's press conference introducing Phil Nevin as his interim manager. \"It's right in front of us.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels have played poorly in almost every aspect, posting the second-lowest OPS and the fourth-highest ERA in the majors during their 14-game losing streak. But they trailed by more than three runs in only about a quarter of the innings they played and lost by a single run seven times while navigating<strong> </strong>a tough slate of games<strong> </strong>that included three teams from a notoriously difficult AL East -- the Red Sox, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a>. Duffy said he believes the team that surged through the early portion of the season is still there, waiting to be unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"Six, seven weeks is a long time to play well,\" he said. \"It's not like it was a two-week spurt against the worst teams in baseball.\"</p>\n<p>Duffy's assertion sits at the core of whether the Angels -- and, thus, Ohtani and Trout, the two most exhilarating players in the sport -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/33886576/mike-trout-shohei-ohtani-october-six-players-help-get-los-angeles-angels-playoffs\">can finally return to the postseason</a> after more than a decade of disappointment. Are they closer to the team that outscored opponents by a combined 53 runs through their first 44 games, or to the team that was outscored by a combined 45 runs over their next 14?</p>\n<p>In an attempt to figure that out, we identified the five biggest reasons for their recent losing streak and determined<strong> </strong>how likely they are to continue.</p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>The bullpen imploded</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>Six of the Angels' 14 losses came in games in which they held leads in the seventh inning or later, a stretch that saw their bullpen blow a major league-leading seven saves.</p>\n<p>Three of those blown saves came in three consecutive games against the Blue Jays. Two others came Sunday against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, when Harper tied the score with his eighth-inning grand slam and the No. 9-hitting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42417/bryson-stott\">Bryson Stott</a> walked it off with a three-run homer.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>This had to particularly sting for Minasian, whose biggest offseason work was done on the bullpen. He brought back his closer, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33618/raisel-iglesias\">Raisel Iglesias</a>, with a four-year, $58 million contract, guaranteed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32397/aaron-loup\">Aaron Loup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32107/ryan-tepera\">Ryan Tepera</a> a combined $31 million to be his setup men and spent $3.75 million to add <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32518/archie-bradley\">Archie Bradley</a>. Those four were on the mound for the vast majority of the demoralizing late damage, combining to allow 24 baserunners and record 32 outs in the six blown leads.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it continue?</strong> Iglesias is one of the best closers in the sport, and if you take away the three earned runs that came as a result of the grand slam he served up to Harper -- during his first appearance in nine days -- his ERA drops significantly. Loup, with a 1.43 ERA and a 0.91 WHIP in 89 appearances the past two years, and Tepera, with a 2.79 ERA and a 0.88 WHIP in 65 appearances last year, have proven they can get outs without throwing at high velocities. Those two have combined for a 4.40 ERA and a 1.18 WHIP in 49 games this season, but their track record suggests they should be better. Just as important for the Angels is for someone like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/3173726/oliver-ortega\">Oliver Ortega</a>, who <em>does </em>possess the big fastball, to show he's capable of handling a high-leverage role. Regardless, this group shouldn't be blowing leads at this rate.</p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mike Trout slumped</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>While the Angels navigated a mystifying losing streak, Trout slumped like he never had before, going hitless in a career-high 26 at-bats.</p>\n<p>On the morning of May 25, Trout held a .328/.436/.693 slash line and led the AL in FanGraphs wins above replacement. Over the Angels' next 12 games, Trout slashed just .114/.204/.205, striking out 17 times and drawing only two walks.</p>\n<p>He actually chased less often during his slump but swung<strong> </strong>and missed at a higher rate. Mostly, he said, he battled issues with his mechanics, particularly with the timing of his front foot, a common explainer when Trout hits a lull offensively. It was a bad slump, but not completely out of the ordinary in this sport, even for a player of Trout's caliber. It just came at the worst possible time.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it continue?</strong> The easy answer here is: Of course not. It's Mike Trout, for crying out loud. Trout showed he might be getting back on track Tuesday night, when he began the game with a 101 mph home run and followed with a 111 mph double. But then he winced as he sprinted out of the batter's box and left the game because of tightness in his left groin, an ailment that kept him out of the lineup the following two nights. The Angels, as well as Trout himself, have called this a minor injury that isn't expected to land him on the IL. But<strong> </strong>this team has shown it can ill-afford prolonged absences from its best players, given how quickly it faded when losing Trout to a calf injury over the last four months last season.</p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Two key hitters got hurt</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a>, who missed the second half of last season because of hip issues, has been out since May 26 because of a tender right wrist. Six days earlier, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34923/taylor-ward\">Taylor Ward</a>, a surprising force at the top of the lineup, slammed his head on a hard spot of the right-field fence. He missed the next four games and struggled through the following eight, only to land on the IL on June 5 because of a hamstring injury.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>The Angels are hoping to have Ward back for Tuesday's game against the Dodgers, but he's still battling the neck stinger he suffered in that collision. Rendon has been taking grounders on the field and swinging in the batting cage, but throwing remains an issue. There's still no timetable for his return.</p>\n<p>With Trout, Rendon and Ward all out this past Tuesday, the Angels had 23-year-old <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40854/jo-adell\">Jo Adell</a> hitting behind Ohtani. Duffy, who has a career .378 slugging percentage, batted in the cleanup spot, and in fifth was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31410/juan-lagares\">Juan Lagares</a>, who didn't have a team until the Angels picked him up on a minor league contract on May 8. The Nos. 7 to 9 hitters -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36418/jack-mayfield\">Jack Mayfield</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28802/kurt-suzuki\">Kurt Suzuki</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33878/tyler-wade\">Tyler Wade</a> -- have posted an OPS+ well below league average since 2019. That is not a winning lineup.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it continue? </strong>It's reasonable to expect Trout, Rendon and Ward will all return before the end of this month, reassembling the lineup that gave the Angels one of the sport's most dynamic offenses through the season's first six weeks. Here's the thing, though: Every team gets hurt. And practically every team must overcome prolonged absences from key contributors. The Angels don't necessarily have the depth to sustain something like that. It hasn't been the case for a while. They need their stars to play regularly and produce, and in any game that they don't, it often seems as if this team has little shot.</p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Shohei Ohtani struggled at both jobs</strong></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n\n\n<p>During the 12-game losing streak that ultimately cost Maddon his job, Ohtani allowed nine runs in nine innings over the course of two starts. Opposing hitters swung at 35 of his fastballs and whiffed on only two of them.</p>\n<p>Offensively, over the same period, Ohtani batted .180/.333/.385 in 48 plate appearances. He still hit the ball hard, but he saw slightly fewer strikes than in the beginning weeks of the season and got a little less BABIP luck.</p>\n<p>At times, with key offensive players out and some of the other pitchers struggling, it has felt like a repeat of 2021, when Rendon and Trout missed the entire second half and Ohtani was basically out there by himself, the only superstar in a lineup that looks way different when not at full strength. Except this time Ohtani isn't producing<strong> </strong>quite the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it continue? </strong>Thursday's win, when Ohtani pitched seven innings of one-run ball and hit an opposite-field home run against a red-hot Red Sox team, showed that the otherworldly ability is still there. Despite his slow start, Ohtani's OPS+ is 25% above the league average, his ERA is 3.64 and his fWAR is 1.8. Chances are, he'll only get better as the season progresses. But one does have to wonder about the type of burden Ohtani carries -- not only as a two-way player, but as someone who barely misses games -- and when that<strong> </strong>might catch up to him.</p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>The rotation lost its way</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>The key to the Angels finally getting back to the postseason -- and their biggest reason for optimism through the first six weeks -- was the performance of their starters, particularly those outside of Ohtani. During the losing streak, however, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard\">Noah Syndergaard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40975/patrick-sandoval\">Patrick Sandoval</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33252/michael-lorenzen\">Michael Lorenzen</a> combined for a 6.67 ERA with only 22 strikeouts and 16 walks in 28 1/3 innings.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>Syndergaard, who still isn't throwing as hard as he used to but is getting outs, followed a bad start with a good one. Sandoval, who looked early on like a top-tier starter in the making, gave up eight runs (seven earned) in 7 2/3 innings over the course of two rough outings. And Lorenzen, who was looking like one of the more savvy offseason additions in the sport, particularly struggled against the Phillies.</p>\n<p>Over the course of those 14 games, Angels starters averaged less than 14 outs per start -- a painful reminder of the team's rotation woes from 2016 to 2021, when only the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a> received fewer fWAR from their starters.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it continue? </strong>This one is especially difficult to pin down because of the overall uncertainty that surrounds the rotation. Sandoval and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4326697/reid-detmers\">Reid Detmers</a> have promise, but they are inexperienced. Syndergaard was an ace, but he barely pitched over the past two years because of Tommy John surgery. Ohtani is a generational talent, but he faces a challenge unlike any player has faced in more than a century. It's hard to know who among them can be counted on for a whole season -- which is, of course, what prompted Minasian to beef up the back end of the bullpen<strong> </strong>in the first place.</p>\n<p>Now, nothing<strong> </strong>seems to be working.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>PHILADELPHIA -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> flailed at strike three in the dirt his final at-bat and a most miserable game was complete.

But postgame talk centered on Trout and the Angels, who fell to their 10th straight defeat.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Trout's previous worst stretch was 0-for-21 in May 2018, and he struck out three times in a game for the fifth time this season.</p>\n<p>\"I'm in it,\" Trout said. \"I've got to get out of it.

Five straight losses have come on the current road trip.</p>\n<p>\"We're just not hitting,\" Angels manager Joe Maddon said. \"We can't cover any of our mistakes. You have to be able to cover a bad lie every once in a while. We're not able to do that right now.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels, whom Maddon termed \"hard to watch\" after their loss Friday, have dropped 14 of 17 games overall and played nothing like the team that started 24-13 and was tied for first in the AL West on May 15. The Angels have scored only four runs over the past four games.</p>\n<p>\"I'll ask you all a question,\" Maddon said Saturday in the postgame availability. \"What should I be angry at? Who should I be angry at? They're busting their butts. We're playing hard. Our prep work is great.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- A light-colored cowboy hat sits atop the bat rack in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>' dugout, a temporary prize for any player who sends a baseball over an outfield fence. The home run ritual was the brainchild of Tim Buss, a coaching assistant Angels manager Joe Maddon calls his \"VP of stuff,\" and it has quickly become the team's most cherished in-game tradition.</p>\n<p>The hat -- an off-white Cody James model with black trim -- was recently outfitted with decals to commemorate every one of these celebrations and is now decorated with 44 of them, representative of the Angels' major league lead in home runs. Four were added on Tuesday alone, amid a 12-0 rout punctuated by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4326697/reid-detmers\">Reid Detmers</a>' improbable <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33895223/los-angeles-angels-rookie-reid-detmers-throws-no-hitter-tampa-bay-rays\">no-hitter</a> against the visiting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a>. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> was graced with the hat upon reentering Angel Stadium's third-base dugout after his second-inning home run, then scampered down the steps and bounced through a parade of high-fives. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33678/chad-wallach\">Chad Wallach</a> did the same in the third, then Trout again in the eighth, then <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a> moments later -- while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLB/status/1524238573062717441\">batting left-handed for the first time in his career</a>, against soft-tossing outfielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33822/brett-phillips\">Brett Phillips</a>.</p>\n<p>It's a ritual akin to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a>'s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joonlee/status/1450975938569777157\">laundry-cart celebration</a>, and a tribute -- coincidentally -- to former Angels owner Gene Autry and his iconic white cowboy hat.</p>\n<p>It also seems to represent something else -- that maybe this year is different.<offer></offer></p>\n<p>It's early, but the Angels' success is already notable. They began Monday having won 19 of their first 30 games for the first time since 2004, then ended it having surpassed a plus-30 run-differential after 31 games for the first time since 1995. When they awoke Wednesday morning, they held a share of the major league lead with 21 victories. By Friday, they'll have a winning record through the first five weeks for only the second time since Trout's first full season.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Trout has reached the postseason only once -- in 2014, when the Angels were swept out of the first round by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a> -- in a career that now spans a dozen years. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, the two-way sensation who signed with the Angels in December of 2017, hasn't even come close. We don't quite know yet if that will change this year, but we can say this confidently: The Angels are <em>fun</em>, not just because of the outsized talent of their two best players but because they play with a noticeable buoyancy.</p>\n<p>It's what second-year general manager Perry Minasian wanted.</p>\n<p>As the son of a longtime clubhouse manager, Minasian has been closely embedded in the fabric of major league teams since he was 7 years old, first as a bat boy, then as a clubbie himself. He's 41 now, nearing the peak of his profession at a time when the industry is exceedingly more reliant on numbers than ever. But he still places a premium on clubhouse chemistry, even if he, like everyone, struggles to explain how the formula works.</p>\n<p>\"It's hard to put a definition on it, or even a one-line sentence to describe it, but I think you have to have a certain balance in the room,\" Minasian said. \"You want the common theme of everybody enjoying showing up and everybody loving to play. You ask every team, they'd want that. But I think the different personalities help the room. It's like dating -- opposites attract, to a certain extent. So you need a little bit of 'different.' And you'd be surprised what type of personalities mesh. We like to have a group where it's not a lot of cliques -- it's a group.\"</p>\n<p>Minasian, a lead executive for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a> from 2018 to 2020, navigated this offseason in search of more edge for his pitching staff, which led him toward the strong personalities of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard\">Noah Syndergaard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33252/michael-lorenzen\">Michael Lorenzen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32397/aaron-loup\">Aaron Loup</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32107/ryan-tepera\">Ryan Tepera</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32518/archie-bradley\">Archie Bradley</a>. One of his few decisions on the position-player side was to re-sign <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28802/kurt-suzuki\">Kurt Suzuki</a>, 38, as his backup catcher because of the respect he commanded from the established stars in the room.</p>\n<p>Minasian can't be certain this all works. At times, he even wonders if he places too much importance on it. But he has seen chemistry matter.</p>\n<p>\"This is the thing about [building a team] -- there's no one way,\" Minasian said. \"And that's what I love about this game. There's no blueprint. There's no one way of doing it, where if you do 'X' you're going to win.\"</p>\n<p>The only two universal necessities, Minasian said, are talent and depth. And no team knows that better than these Angels, who have struggled to contend despite employing two of the most transformative talents of this era. At the height of their powers, Trout and Ohtani make up one of the best tandems in baseball history. But they long to display their talents on baseball's grandest stage, and they can't get there alone. The stars need help, even with the postseason field expanded. Lots of it.</p>\n<p>Below, we identified their most important supporting cast members.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>Noah Syndergaard</strong></p>\n<p>Last November, immediately after the GM meetings in Carlsbad, California, Minasian flew across the country to recruit the former <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> ace over dinner. Syndergaard underwent Tommy John surgery in March 2020 and didn't return to a major league game until the 2021 season was winding down, producing only two innings of work. But Minasian believed the 29-year-old right-hander could be the type of top-flight starting pitcher the Angels had lacked since Jered Weaver was in his prime.</p>\n<p>The Angels signed Syndergaard to a one-year, $21 million contract and crossed their fingers. He has pitched to expectations thus far, posting a 2.45 ERA in 29⅔ innings through five starts, but he's succeeding differently. Syndergaard's fastball is down from the upper 90s to the mid 90s and he is relying more heavily on his changeup and his sinker, the latter of which has limited opposing hitters to an .088 slugging percentage. He's striking out fewer batters (his strikeout percentage was 26.3% from 2015 to 2019 and sits at 17.5% this year), but he's still generating weak contact.</p>\n<p>As Syndergaard builds stamina and arm strength after so much time away, the velocity might tick back up along with the strikeouts. But this version of Syndergaard is already far better than any of the bargain free-agent starters the Angels have signed in recent years. The last four were <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32106/jose-quintana\">Jose Quintana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31091/julio-teheran\">Julio Teheran</a>, Matt Harvey and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30054/trevor-cahill\">Trevor Cahill</a>. They each signed one-year deals totaling less than $40 million and combined for a 6.93 ERA.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Rendon</strong></p>\n<p>The Angels signed Rendon to a seven-year, $245 million contract in December 2019 hoping he would join forces with Trout and Ohtani to give them one of the best lineups in the sport. But they have yet to receive the full Rendon experience. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic shortened the season to 60 games. In 2021, Rendon was limited to roughly that amount because of injury.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Last year, the 31-year-old third baseman suffered a groin strain in April, fouled a ball off his knee in May, landed on the injured list with a hamstring injury in July, then learned he was dealing with an impingement in his right hip that made it difficult for him to properly rotate on his swing and prevented him from sinking into his legs on defense. He underwent season-ending surgery in August.</p>\n<p>But during spring training, Angels coaches raved about how much healthier Rendon looked. It hasn't yet manifested itself in the numbers, but Rendon is hitting the ball hard and isn't chasing -- trends that usually portend good results. Despite batting only .206/.319/.373, Rendon ranks within the top 20% in average exit velocity and boasts the second-lowest chase rate in the majors.</p>\n<p>The Angels often note that the team won 77 games last year even though Trout, Ohtani and Rendon were in the same lineup only 17 times. It's partly a source of pride. A healthy Rendon can have almost as big an impact as Ohtani or Trout. At his best, he is a premium defender and one of the best pure hitters in the sport.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40975/patrick-sandoval\">Patrick Sandoval</a></strong></p>\n<p>The biggest reason Trout has yet to win a postseason game boils down to what Sandoval embodies: young, talented, effective, affordable starting pitching. It's the most coveted asset in the industry, the absence of which drove the Angels to draft college pitchers with 19 of their 20 picks last year (the other pick: a <em>high school</em> pitcher).</p>\n<p>Sandoval isn't technically homegrown -- he was acquired in a trade that sent veteran catcher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30289/martin-maldonado\">Martin Maldonado</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> in July 2018 -- but he spent time in the Angels' system and, most importantly, is providing quality innings before reaching his arbitration years.</p>\n<p>Sandoval, 25, didn't allow an earned run through his first 15 innings and boasts a 2.03 ERA through five starts. Some on the Angels believe he might have the best stuff on the staff, Ohtani and Syndergaard included. Hitters are 0-for-30 with 20 strikeouts in at-bats that have ended on his changeup, making it the second-most-valuable changeup among pitchers who have accumulated at least 20 innings. They're batting just .143/.243/.179 off his slider.</p>\n<p>The two pitches come out of the same plane and break in opposite directions at the very end, making it very difficult for hitters to distinguish. This year, Sandoval has also done a better job slowing his delivery and not opening up his front shoulder, thus making his mechanics more repeatable. Angels starters had the fifth-worst ERA and the second-fewest innings in the sport over the past three years.</p>\n<p>The last Angel to combine at least 150 innings with an ERA under 4.00 in a pre-arbitration season: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32058/matt-shoemaker\">Matt Shoemaker</a>, famously undrafted, in 2016. Sandoval and Detmers could both conceivably do it this year.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34923/taylor-ward\">Taylor Ward</a></strong></p>\n<p>A popular thought surrounding the Angels heading into 2022 was that one of their young corner outfielders needed to emerge. But that thought was centered on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40803/brandon-marsh\">Brandon Marsh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40854/jo-adell\">Jo Adell</a>; very few outsiders had Ward as their breakout pick heading into his age-28 season. And yet, nearly five weeks in, Ward ranks second only to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31097/manny-machado\">Manny Machado</a> in batting average and second only to Trout in OPS among major league hitters who have accumulated at least 95 plate appearances. There are 159 players who have come to bat more often than Ward, and yet only three of them have drawn more walks, which is pretty ideal for someone who has settled into the leadoff spot of a lineup featuring Trout, Ohtani, Rendon and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35673/jared-walsh\">Jared Walsh</a>.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Ward, a first-round pick by the Angels out of Fresno State in 2015, couldn't stick as a professional catcher and struggled with infrequent playing time in the majors, batting .230/.305/.388 in 159 games from 2018 to 2021. But Ward consistently displayed elite power and patience in the upper minor league levels during that stretch, most notably in a 13-game sample in Triple-A last year, when he batted an otherworldly .429/.525/.857. The thought was Ward simply needed consistent playing time to thrive as a major league hitter, a notion he supported with an impressive showing in spring training.</p>\n<p>That spark prompted the Angels to release Justin Upton with $28 million remaining on the final year of his contract, paving the way for Ward to take over as the everyday right fielder. It might be the best transaction any team has made this season.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Loup and Ryan Tepera</strong></p>\n<p>Remove <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33618/raisel-iglesias\">Raisel Iglesias</a>, and the Angels' bullpen had a collective 4.83 ERA last year, which would've been sixth-highest in the majors. Yes, plenty of bullpens would drop off significantly if you removed their best reliever. But the point is that the Angels didn't possess a proper bridge to one of the game's best closers. That reality, coupled with a starting rotation that didn't absorb enough innings, produced a toxic combination.</p>\n<p>Bringing back Iglesias on a four-year, $58 million contract was crucial to the Angels' hopes of contending. But so were the other moves Minasian made in the bullpen, namely signing Tepera, a right-hander, and Loup, a lefty, as setup men.</p>\n<p>Loup and Tepera, both 34, were drafted by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in 2009, the same year Minasian joined the organization as a scout. Loup rode a low-90s sinker and a mid-80s cutter from a funky sidearm delivery to dominate for the Mets last year, posting a 0.95 ERA in 56⅔ innings. Tepera tunneled mostly a low-90s fastball and a mid-80s slider from an over-the-top delivery to post a 2.79 ERA in 61⅓ innings with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> in 2021.</p>\n<p>The last time the Angels reached the postseason, in 2014, they boasted a dominant back end of the bullpen featuring Kevin Jepsen, Jason Grilli, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28729/joe-smith\">Joe Smith</a> and Huston Street. If Loup, Tepera and Iglesias can help replicate that, the Angels could be a sustained force.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>The season didn't begin until April 7, so it's a shorter than normal April -- but it's never too early to dig into some of the numbers. Let's pick our April All-Stars for each league and see how many of those players off to hot starts this month might still be under All-Star consideration come July.</p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>American League</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Catcher: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31127/salvador-perez\">Salvador Perez</a>, Royals</strong></p>\n<p>Perez's transformation from free-swinging hacker with moderate power to free-swinging hacker with enormous power has been one of the unlikeliest developments of the past couple of seasons. It's really quite amazing to watch: He just goes up there and takes the biggest, hardest swing you can imagine, swings at almost everything and when he connects ... boom.</p>\n<p>He tied for the AL lead with 48 home runs in 2021, and according to a quirky Statcast measurement that projects the same home runs to other parks, he would have hit 60 for the White Sox, Mets or Reds. Given that he DHs when he's not catching, he's a threat to once again lead the league in home runs.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> He's already a seven-time All-Star and six-time starter. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30950/yasmani-grandal\">Yasmani Grandal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32657/mike-zunino\">Mike Zunino</a>, who had strong offensive seasons in 2021, are both struggling, so Perez is pretty much a lock to start again.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>First base: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35591/ty-france\">Ty France</a>, Mariners</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I hear you, Yankees fans. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30782/anthony-rizzo\">Anthony Rizzo</a> leads the majors in home runs after his three-homer outburst on Tuesday, so this is a close call indeed since France and Rizzo were tied in WAR after Tuesday's action. France is on his own hot streak, however, with 19 RBIs over his past 13 games. If you're surprised by his start, you shouldn't be. This guy has always hit, including a .399 average for Triple-A El Paso in 2019. The Mariners stole him from the Padres and he hit .291 last season, posting a .321 mark in the second half.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Well, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>. is going to be the starter, but with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32767/matt-olson\">Matt Olson</a> now over in the National League, the backup spot is wide open. I like France's odds and given that he leads the majors in batting average since last year's All-Star break, he's a legit contender for the batting title.</p>\n<p><strong>Second base: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30765/dj-lemahieu\">DJ LeMahieu</a>, Yankees</strong></p>\n<p>He's started games at second, third and first, but with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32146/marcus-semien\">Marcus Semien</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39961/brandon-lowe\">Brandon Lowe</a> both hitting under .200, he's the only AL second baseman off to a good start at the plate. After hitting .336 with power across 2019 and 2020, LeMahieu fell off to .268 with just 10 home runs last season. The big change so far: He's been more aggressive in his swing rates, both on first pitches and overall. That's led to more swing and misses, but also harder contact.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Sure, this guy was a top five MVP candidate in 2019 and 2020. While I expect Semien and Lowe to eventually find their strokes, LeMahieu appears to be making the adjustments to get him back to a fourth All-Star Game.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Third base: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32801/jose-ramirez\">Jose Ramirez</a>, Guardians</strong></p>\n<p>New contract, same awesome production. Due to a better than normal -- for him -- line-drive rate, he's hitting over .300, which he hasn't done since 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Try legit MVP candidate -- as usual. He has four top-six finishes since 2017, including sixth last season.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Shortstop: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40929/wander-franco\">Wander Franco</a>, Rays</strong></p>\n<p>The numbers speak for themselves, but the Statcast metrics back up the early results: 84th percentile in hard-hit rate, 99th percentile in expected batting average, 99th percentile in strikeout rate.</p>\n<p>Maybe the most impressive aspect is he's also been outstanding defensively, including one memorable running grab of a popup down the left-field line. If we're going to nitpick, the chase rate is a little high at the plate and he doesn't walk, but remember: He still has less than 100 games playing in the big leagues.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Absolutely. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33210/jp-crawford\">J.P. Crawford</a> has been outstanding for the Mariners and this loaded position includes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31606/xander-bogaerts\">Xander Bogaerts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32691/corey-seager\">Corey Seager</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33184/tim-anderson\">Tim Anderson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38904/bo-bichette\">Bo Bichette</a>, but I expect Franco to be at Dodger Stadium in July for what should be the first of many All-Star appearances.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Outfield: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, Angels</strong></p>\n<p>Stay healthy, big guy.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Well, Buster Olney <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33803710/a-10-war-season-move-babe-ruth-our-hottest-hot-takes-two-plus-weeks-mlb-season\">predicted 60 home runs from Trout</a>. That pace will land him his 10th All-Star bid.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Outfield: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32655/byron-buxton\">Byron Buxton</a>, Twins</strong></p>\n<p>The most impressive home run I've seen so far was Buxton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IE_MLB/status/1512900483861688320\">turning on a 100.5-mph fastball</a> up in the zone from Mariners reliever <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40939/andres-munoz\">Andres Munoz</a> and crushing it into the third deck at Target Field (somehow estimated at just 436 feet). The second most impressive homer might have been Buxton's walk-off on Sunday off <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31755/liam-hendriks\">Liam Hendriks</a> of the White Sox, an absurd 469-foot blast off a 96-mph fastball. In less than half a season's worth of games over the past two seasons, he's hit .313/.366/.688 with 25 home runs and Gold Glove-level defense.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Yes and normally I'd say put him in the Home Run Derby ... but let's just get him into the game. He missed six of the Twins' first 16 games, so it's all about staying on the field.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Outfield: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steven Kwan</a>, Guardians</strong></p>\n<p>The rookie was the story of the first week of the season after he hit .692 in a four-game series against the Royals, including a 5-for-5 performance. He's slowed since but still began the week second to Trout in wRC+ among qualified AL outfielders. The plate discipline and contact ability are top shelf, although a lack of power limits his offensive upside. Still, he projects as a classic old-school leadoff hitter as a player who can hit around .300 with a high OBP.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> It's not a reach, but I wouldn't bet on it, especially since the Guardians will have other strong All-Star candidates in Ramirez and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40912/shane-bieber\">Shane Bieber</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Designated hitter: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, Angels</strong></p>\n<p>OK, he's not exactly smacking the cover off the ball like he did 46 times last summer ... but neither are any other AL DHs. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36018/yordan-alvarez\">Yordan Alvarez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30583/giancarlo-stanton\">Giancarlo Stanton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33339/franmil-reyes\">Franmil Reyes</a> are all under .200. And none of those guys have fanned 26 batters in 14⅓ innings.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Of course. Here's a question: How bad would Ohtani have to be to <em>not</em> make the All-Star team? He's the reason we have an All-Star Game. It's probably a moot question since the fans will almost certainly vote him in as a starter.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Starting pitcher: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32667/kevin-gausman\">Kevin Gausman</a>, Blue Jays</strong></p>\n<p>I originally was going to go with Rays sophomore lefty <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41199/shane-mcclanahan\">Shane McClanahan</a> here, but after watching Gausman carve up the Red Sox on Tuesday, he gets the nod. It's hard to ignore a 31-to-0 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He has also yet to allow a home run as his split-finger is once again unhittable -- he allowed a .133 average with it last season and .125 so far in 2022. The Blue Jays' decision to sign Gausman and let Cy Young winner <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32175/robbie-ray\">Robbie Ray</a> walk in free agency looks like a pretty nice exchange right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Absolutely. If anything, he looks even better than he did last year for the Giants, although we should note he also had a spectacular first half in 2021 when he earned his first All-Star selection before tiring in the second half (4.42 ERA).</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Relief pitcher: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40429/michael-king\">Michael King</a>, Yankees</strong></p>\n<p>Most relievers haven't thrown many innings yet, but King is stepping up as a dominant multi-inning weapon with a 44% strikeout rate early on. He always produced as a starter in the minors, but the knock against him was lack of velocity. Well, that has crept up to 96 in relief and he has maintained his plus command. The Yankees may be tempted to start him if he keeps pitching like this, but I'd keep him in that valuable multi-inning role.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>It's tough for a non-closer to make the All-Star team, but King is definitely legit and with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32827/clay-holmes\">Clay Holmes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32030/lucas-luetge\">Lucas Luetge</a> to go with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33325/chad-green\">Chad Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39807/jonathan-loaisiga\">Jonathan Loaisiga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30442/aroldis-chapman\">Aroldis Chapman</a>, the Yankees appear to have one of the deepest pens in the majors.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>NATIONAL LEAGUE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Catcher: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32177/jt-realmuto\">J.T. Realmuto</a>, Phillies</strong></p>\n<p>There's no clear leader here, but Realmuto is hitting around .300 with his usual excellent defense, giving him the edge over <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32532/willson-contreras\">Willson Contreras</a> of the Cubs and up-and-coming <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34975/tyler-stephenson\">Tyler Stephenson</a> of the Reds.</p>\n<p>Sadly, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5986/yadier-molina\">Yadier Molina</a> is struggling to get any offense going -- no runs, no RBIs, no extra-base hits in his first 10 games --so normally it would seem his chances of making an All-Star appearance in his final season would come down to the fan vote. This year, however, a new rule gives the commissioner the ability to add a 33rd player to each league's All-Star roster \"in recognition of each player's career achievements\" and could add more than one player \"if special circumstances warrant.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Sure. Realmuto started last year's contest and has made the past three All-Star teams.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>First base: Matt Olson, Braves ... and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30193/freddie-freeman\">Freddie Freeman</a>, Dodgers (tie)</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I can't decide. Both are off to great starts with Olson racking up doubles and walks and Freeman showing his usual all-around brilliance at the plate. It wouldn't be surprising to see both in the MVP discussion at season's end.</p>\n<p>And yes, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30993/eric-hosmer\">Eric Hosmer</a> is hitting over .400. No, I don't think that .469 BABIP will last.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Stars? </strong>Yep.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Second base: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41433/jazz-chisholm-jr\">Jazz Chisholm Jr</a>., Marlins</strong></p>\n<p>How can you not go for the guy with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/33630100/expanded-playoffs-ohtani-rule-new-team-name-everything-different-mlb-2022\">the ice cream accented glove</a>? And that glove warrants special mention, because he's a Gold Glove contender in the field and -- so far -- his offense is looking improved over his rookie season with good power numbers and less chasing on pitches outside the zone. He was electrifying but inconsistent as a rookie, and if he can put it all together, Chisholm has a chance to be one of the most exciting stars in the game.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> I'm not quite ready to go there yet. The strikeout rate is still high and he started off hot last season as well, so let's see if he can maintain his approach and cut down on the whiffs. Plus, second base in the NL is pretty deep with perennial All-Star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33783/ozzie-albies\">Ozzie Albies</a>, 2021 Rookie of the Year <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41171/jonathan-india\">Jonathan India</a> and good starts from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39907/tommy-edman\">Tommy Edman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33900/jeff-mcneil\">Jeff McNeil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40423/gavin-lux\">Gavin Lux</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Third base: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31097/manny-machado\">Manny Machado</a>, Padres</strong></p>\n<p>This is basically a coin flip between Machado and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31261/nolan-arenado\">Nolan Arenado</a>, who ranked 1-2 among NL position players in both Baseball-Reference and FanGraphs WAR entering Tuesday's games. And <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34982/austin-riley\">Austin Riley</a> isn't far behind as he proves last year's breakout was for real. I'm going with Machado, as Arenado's two-out throwing error in the ninth inning of Monday's game against the Mets cost the Cardinals a win.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Yes. Hard to believe this is already Machado's fourth season with the Padres. He's been a little up and down with the Padres -- OK in 2019 (2.6 WAR), great in the COVID season (third in the MVP voting) and an All-Star in 2021 (5.0 WAR). Early on, he's on pace for his best season since back-to-back 7-WAR campaigns with the Orioles in 2015 and 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortstop: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor\">Francisco Lindor</a>, Mets</strong></p>\n<p>Now this is the player we expected to see last season. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr\">Fernando Tatis Jr</a>. injured, Corey Seager in the AL and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30469/brandon-crawford\">Brandon Crawford</a> off to so-so starts, Lindor's strong three weeks -- including a two-homer game in the Mets' home opener -- makes him our April All-Star.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Sure, although he didn't play at an All-Star level in 2020 or 2021, leading many to fear that he was in decline even though he's still just 28.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Outfield: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4142424/seiya-suzuki\">Seiya Suzuki</a>, Cubs</strong></p>\n<p>He's the first outfield name here and deservedly so after an impressive start to his major league career. He's hitting for average, power and drawing a lot of walks. It's an impressive offensive package, just like he showed in Japan. The plate discipline has stood out as he ranks in the 98th percentile in chase rate, helping him produce one of the best barrel rates in the league so far. Despite excellent speed, the defense has been underwhelming in right field -- the only apparent weakness in his game.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>I'll say yes, although he's riding an unsustainable .448 BABIP. He mashed in Japan and has adapted quickly to the velocity here. I don't see this as a Kosuke Fukudome situation. You may remember the Cubs signed him in 2008 and he started the All-Star Game that summer despite so-so numbers. He was a nice player, but Suzuki has star potential.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Outfield: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31392/joc-pederson\">Joc Pederson</a>, Giants</strong></p>\n<p>Despite serving as a platoon player, he's put up some of the best numbers in the NL, slotting in as the Giants' cleanup hitter against right-handers. Pederson has gone on these kinds of benders before, so let's see if he can keep it going. Either way, he's looking like a free-agent bargain at $6 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Not really, although he did make the All-Star team as a rookie in 2015 and he's been a staple in the Home Run Derby. But he's a platoon guy with a 90 OPS+ over 2020-21. Then again, it seems every veteran the Giants have brought in the past few seasons has improved.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Outfield: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39957/jesus-sanchez\">Jesus Sanchez</a>, Marlins</strong></p>\n<p>Flip a coin here: Sanchez, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32159/brandon-nimmo\">Brandon Nimmo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31187/nick-castellanos\">Nick Castellanos</a>. Heck, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33712/kyle-schwarber\">Kyle Schwarber</a> deserves consideration just for that All-Star-level outburst against Angel Hernandez. But let's highlight a young hitter in Sanchez, in his first full season with the Marlins. He's from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32127/javier-baez\">Javier Baez</a> school -- swing hard and swing often. OK, he's not quite as undisciplined as Baez, but you get the idea: this man does not go up there looking for walks. We'll see how that plays out in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star?</strong> Not really. He can hit, but the lack of walks will limit his OBP and he's been playing center field for the Marlins where he's not good despite above-average speed, so the defense will hold down his overall value.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Designated hitter: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35440/connor-joe\">Connor Joe</a>, Rockies</strong></p>\n<p>Joe was originally drafted by the Pirates, traded to the Braves and then the Dodgers. He was selected by the Reds in the Rule 5 draft and then traded to the Giants, only to be returned to the Dodgers and then signed by the Rockies as a free agent before the 2021 season. Got all that? He is 29 years old and getting his first shot at full-time play. He's played some left field, some right field and some first base, but most of his starts have come at DH. He had a 118 OPS+ in 211 plate appearances and the one reason for optimism is he has very good contact skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Probably not, but you never know what kind of numbers a good contact hitter can put up in Coors Field. The plate discipline is a plus and while the exit velocity is below average, he could hit .300 with 20 to 25 home runs ... and not a lot of players are going to hit .300 in 2022.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Starting pitcher: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28976/max-scherzer\">Max Scherzer</a>, Mets</strong></p>\n<p>Considering he went five innings in his first spring training outing, you knew Scherzer was locked in for a strong start to 2022. He's allowed five runs through his first four starts with 33 K's and just one home run in 25 innings -- and just three hits allowed in 14 innings over his past two outings. He's been in the top five of the Cy Young voting every season since 2013 except during COVID, so while the NL Cy Young race promises to be a crowded affair, Scherzer is the one pitcher who is there <em>every</em> year -- and it doesn't look like he's slowing down.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Legit Hall of Famer.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Relief pitcher: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41086/keegan-thompson\">Keegan Thompson</a>, Cubs</strong></p>\n<p>He's started the season with 13⅔ scoreless innings, pitching at least 2⅔ innings in each of his four outings and picking up two wins. His fastball is rather pedestrian -- for a reliever -- at 93.5 mph, but it's a high-spin fastball and he mixes it well with a cutter and curveball and he's showing much improved control from 2021, when he walked 5⅔ batters per nine.</p>\n<p><strong>Legit All-Star? </strong>Well, you know ... good relievers can come out of nowhere. The Cubs intend to keep him in relief for now, but if he keeps throwing up zeroes the temptation to try him again in the rotation will be difficult to resist.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>We are nearly three weeks into the new MLB season, with teams across the majors approaching their 20th game played. In the grand scheme of a 162-game schedule, what has happened so far means -- well, not a whole lot. But what's the fun in saying that?</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we asked our MLB experts to go all-in on what they've seen by making a prediction based on this small sample size. They were allowed to pick anything they wanted with two conditions: It had to be bold, and it had to be something they truly believe could happen. </p>\n<p>Some of our predictors went really bold, while others chose to play it more safe, so we took the liberty of ranking them from mild to spicy. Here is what they chose. </p>\n\n\n<h2>Take a walk on the mild side</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p><strong>The Orioles are going to strike out more than anyone in MLB history </strong></p>\n<p><strong>AJ Mass: </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a>, who already have nine players with double-digit strikeout totals, will end up breaking the record for most players on a team with more than 100 whiffs in a single season, en route to becoming the first club to hit the 1,600-strikeout mark for a season -- and they'll do it with the lowest team batting average in a full 162-game season, too.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><strong>Why it's mild: </strong>Look, you predicted a major league record, and that in itself is bold. But there are two things we all know for sure going into a modern baseball season: (1) A bunch of strikeout records are going to fall; and (2) the Orioles are going to be bad. So we give you credit for the effort, but we just can't go beyond that.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The White Sox won't win the AL Central </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jesse Rogers: </strong>I consider this an extremely hot take because the White Sox are the most talented team in a division that they won last season, but once in a while things don't go as planned. April has opened the door for other teams, and one of them -- I'm not sure who yet -- is going to win the division. Minnesota, Cleveland and Detroit can all make a case for the title, but the Guardians might have the best chance. They have a veteran manager, more offense than people thought and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40912/shane-bieber\">Shane Bieber</a> is looking like the Shane Bieber of old. Just because the White Sox overcame injuries last season, doesn't mean they will again.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's mild:</strong> When we released <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33645791/2022-mlb-predictions-expanded-playoffs-world-series-mvps-cy-youngs\">our predictions going into the MLB season</a> less than a month ago, 34 of our 38 experts predicted the White Sox would win the AL Central. The other four predicted the Twins. Now <em>those</em> folks were bold. We still appreciate you being willing to make this call after 15 games, but you stopped short of choosing who would top the White Sox -- and that alone took some serious heat off your prediction. But we have a feeling this won't be the last White Sox hot take we get today. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33912/cody-bellinger\">Cody Bellinger</a> will be a 5-WAR player for the Dodgers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Alden Gonzalez:</strong> I don't know if we'll ever again see the Cody Bellinger who terrorized pitchers through the first half of the 2019 season, but I also don't know that we need to. Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP and amazingly one of the worst hitters in the sport in 2021, will settle into who he is this year -- a high-impact player who will at times look dominant and at times, perhaps briefly, look lost. Sunday's two-homer, two-strikeout afternoon offered a perfect snapshot. Through his first 15 games, Bellinger had four home runs, three stolen bases and a .915 OPS, but also 20 strikeouts in 60 at-bats. He brings elite power and speed, not to mention strong defense at a premium position, but he also strikes out a lot. The Dodgers will take that.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's mild: </strong>We get it, Bellinger was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/insider/story/_/id/32426084/what-went-wrong-los-angeles-dodgers-cody-bellinger-2021-fix-next-season\">really bad last season</a>. But he also has an NL MVP Award and is 26 years old. Combine that with the fact that Bellinger is off to exactly the start the Dodgers were hoping he would have, as you mentioned. With that in mind, we're just not sure how much heat predicting Belli becomes Belli again actually carries. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>We're heating up</h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40929/wander-franco\">Wander Franco</a> is going to be the MVP of the American League</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bradford Doolittle:</strong> I've seen enough proof of concept already. He has, almost impossibly, lived up to his 80-grade hit tool as a prospect, but he's more than that. Power from both sides of the plate. Great defense. A flair for the dramatic. And he's already a clubhouse leader for the Rays as someone willing to fight through minor injuries to stay on the field and whose excellence delights his older teammates. Franco's stat line is already the first thing I look at when I dig into the daily box scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Tristan Cockcroft:</strong> I agree with Brad here. Franco will become only the sixth 21-year-old (or younger) in history with 200-plus hits and 300-plus total bases, en route to winning the American League's MVP Award.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's got some heat: </strong>OK, predicting a 21-year-old in his first season to win a major award is bold in its own right. But we've all seen Wander Franco play and the guy is incredibly good! So yeah, we'll give you credit for predicting Franco will outperform the likes of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>. and the reigning MVP <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> -- but here's the thing: How bold can this prediction be if two of you were willing to make it?</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33696/carlos-rodon\">Carlos Rodon</a> will be the best signing of last offseason's free-agent class</strong></p>\n<p><strong>David Schoenfield:</strong> A record 11 free agents signed contracts of at least $100 million this offseason, but the best signing will be Carlos Rodon. Through three starts, the left-hander has allowed two runs in 17 innings, with a blistering 29 strikeouts and just eight hits allowed. Most importantly, his velocity, which tailed off in the second half last season in his return from Tommy John surgery, is back at full volume, averaging 96.4 mph. The Giants worked wonders with veteran starters last season, and they've had Rodon scrap his changeup (batters hit .367 off it in 2021) and focus on his fastball-slider combo. His two-year deal already looks like a bargain, and even if he opts out after 2022, the Giants will gladly take a Cy Young-caliber season.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><strong>Why it's got some heat: </strong>Everyone has their own definitions of hot -- and this one is certainly right on the border of downright spicy. You mentioned that there are 11 free agents who signed $100 million deals last offseason, and that list includes some of the best players in the entire sport -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28976/max-scherzer\">Max Scherzer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30193/freddie-freeman\">Freddie Freeman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32691/corey-seager\">Corey Seager</a>, to name a few. But Carlos Rodon was also very good last year, posting a 2.37 ERA and finishing in the top five of the AL Cy Young voting, and now he's in San Francisco, where the Giants have turned every starting pitcher they've touched into gold. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Now that's spicy</h2>\n<p><photo5></p>\n<p><strong>The Astros' new shortstop will be better than the Astros' old shortstop</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Eric Karabell: </strong>Nothing against new Twins shortstop Carlos Correa, but new Astros shortstop <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41273/jeremy-pena\">Jeremy Pena</a> is going to finish the season with a higher WAR and offer considerably more value to his team. Again, Correa is awesome, even though he is off to a rough start at the plate, but Pena looks more awesome, not just defensively -- where he might be a legitimate Gold Glove contender even as a rookie -- but with his power and plate discipline. He hit a game-winning home run over the weekend and could hit atop the team's lineup. The Astros knew what they were doing, trusting this critical defensive position to someone with no big league experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's spicy: </strong>Correa was the No. 1 free agent in a loaded class and is arguably the best shortstop in the entire sport. Jeremy Pena, on the other hand, has all of 50 major league at-bats to his name. And here you are willing to declare that Pena won't just fill Correa's shoes in Houston this season -- but that he will be better than him? That is what we call bringing the heat. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tony La Russa won't last the season in Chicago</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tim Keown: </strong>Chalk this up at least partly to recency bias -- the White Sox have lost seven straight as of this writing -- but La Russa's run as manager in Chicago won't last two full seasons. The White Sox underachieved last season, losing in the division series just as they did in Rick Renteria's final year, and a 6-9 start with a stacked roster in baseball's weakest division doesn't bode well. He has made head-scratching decisions recently -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30664/leury-garcia\">Leury Garcia</a> should never hit third in that lineup -- in defiance of both analytics and common sense. His old-school explanations, like wanting to jump-start Garcia, he of the .261 OPS, by hitting him in front of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33095/jose-abreu\">Jose Abreu</a>, haven't helped the cause in the slightest.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's spicy: </strong>La Russa has been back in Chicago one season and the White Sox won the AL Central title in that one season. So you aren't just saying it will go south on the South Side, you are saying that things will go sideways so quickly that the White Sox change directions before the end of this season. That is in a word: bold. So why isn't it in an even spicier spot on our list? After seeing the way La Russa's first year in Chicago played out, nothing that happens would surprise us all that much -- and somehow, the takes get even spicier from here.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blazing hot</h2>\n<p><photo4></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32655/byron-buxton\">Byron Buxton</a> is going to deliver one of the best seasons in MLB history</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jeff Passan: </strong>The gold standard for an all-time great season is the 10-WAR mark, and over the past 50 years, only eight position players have done it, according to FanGraphs: Barry Bonds five times, Mike Trout twice and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a>, Rickey Henderson, Joe Morgan, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30112/buster-posey\">Buster Posey</a>, Alex Rodriguez and Cal Ripken Jr. once apiece. Minnesota center fielder Byron Buxton will join the club in 2022. This is a Carolina Reaper not because of Buxton's talent but his difficulty in staying on the field.</p>\n<p>Since 2019, he has missed 203 of the Twins' 400 games. And yet over the past two seasons, Buxton is averaging an absurd .076 WAR per game -- higher than Mike Trout (.069), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr\">Fernando Tatis Jr</a>. (.056), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36185/ronald-acuna-jr\">Ronald Acuna Jr</a>. (.052), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32801/jose-ramirez\">Jose Ramirez</a> (.045) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a> (.044). At that pace, Buxton needs to play only 132 games to hit the 10-win threshold. While he's done that only once -- in 2017, when he played 140 games -- and already missed six this season with a knee issue, Buxton is so great it's worth dreaming, however futile it might be, of what a full year of his resplendence might look like.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><strong>Why it's blazing hot: </strong>Predicting that this is finally going to be the year for Byron Buxton is an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31215490/our-hottest-hot-takes-one-week-2021-mlb-season\">April tradition around here</a>. Everyone who has seen Buxton play this season can attest to just how talented he is and what he's capable of doing when he's on the field -- with how long he can actually stay on the field being the big question.</p>\n<p>But you came at this with a new twist: You put a specific number on Buxton's season. Ten WAR!? We looked into Mike Trout's two 10-WAR seasons and he played 157 and 159 games. Buxton, on the other hand, has already missed a week this season. So you aren't just predicting that Buxton will be good, and healthy, you are predicting the player we will see from here until the end of 2022 will be in the handful of the very best in the history of the sport. A Carolina Reaper indeed.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>Mike Trout is going to become the first player in more than two decades to hit 60 homers in a season. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Buster Olney: </strong>He seems to improve every year, as his raw skill is stoked by enhanced knowledge of how pitchers will work to him, and now that he has protection in front of and behind him in the Angels' lineup, he'll get more pitches to hit. His two-homer game over the weekend was a sign of things to come. He's got three doubles, four homers and a .690 slugging percentage so far in 2022. Barry Bonds was the last player to reach the 60 benchmark, when he clubbed 73 homers 21 years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's blazing hot: </strong>Did you say <em>60</em>? I mean, you would have had us at 50. Mike Trout has worn the crown of best player in baseball for a decade and never hit more than 45 in a single season. So let's get this straight: At age 30, in the year of the non-home run across baseball, Trout is going to skip 50 and hit 60? We ... love it! This is exactly the kind of spice we're looking for here. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>You sure you can handle this heat?</h2>\n<p><photo6></p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4574/albert-pujols\">Albert Pujols</a> passes Babe Ruth on the all-time HR list this season</strong>\n<p><strong>Paul Hembekides: </strong>Albert Pujols is up to 681 career home runs, 15 away from A-Rod and 33 away from the Babe. A year ago this time he looked washed up, but he owns a .256/.305/.470 batting line with 14 homers in 93 games since the Angels released him. Early returns this season suggest there is plenty of zing left in that barrel (90.4 mph average exit velocity), and he has vastly outperformed the Cardinals' other DH options (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31684/corey-dickerson\">Corey Dickerson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4448736/lars-nootbaar\">Lars Nootbaar</a>). Give The Machine 400-500 at-bats, and we just might see him chase down 714.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's in a category of its own: </strong>You want to know which three words get our attention really fast? \"Passes Babe Ruth.\" Predicting a career year for Byron Buxton? Very bold. Calling 60 home runs for Trout? That is very spicy. But saying Albert Pujols will pass Babe Ruth on the all-time home run list this year? Literally lava. Now excuse us while we go prepare to see history.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Two weeks into the Major League Baseball season, offense is down, home runs are disappearing, complete games are nonexistent and the overreaction machine is working in overdrive.</p>\n<p>You have questions. We have answers.</p>\n<p><strong>It feels like my team isn't scoring very much. Am I wrong?</strong></p>\n<p>Nope. Scoring has dropped, and it's almost entirely attributable to one big change from last year. This year's batting average (.234) is identical to last year's through 10 team games. On-base percentage is up .001. But the leaguewide slugging percentage is down from .392 each of the past two years to .380 this season. Accordingly, runs per game have dipped from 4.44 last season to 4.22 this year -- nearly a 5% decrease.</p>\n<p>And that's because home runs are down. Like, way down, as the numbers from ESPN Stats & Information's Mike Bonzagni show. And while the rates certainly grow as the weather warms, numbers since MLB introduced Statcast starting in 2015 indicate the difference between those exhibited through 10 games aren't altogether different from a full 162-game season.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p>Percentage of plate appearances ending in a HR</p>\n<p><strong>Year First 10 All 162</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2015</strong> 3.80% 4.20%</p>\n<p><strong>2016 </strong>4.43% 4.86%</p>\n<p><strong>2017</strong> 4.79% 5.26%</p>\n<p><strong>2018</strong> 4.22% 4.81%</p>\n<p><strong>2019</strong> 5.56% 5.85%</p>\n<p><strong>2020</strong> 4.87% 5.27%</p>\n<p><strong>2021</strong> 4.79% 4.89%</p>\n<p><strong>2022</strong> 3.93%</p>\n<p>Over the past seven seasons, teams have finished the season averaging 0.2 more runs per game for the season than they did in April. Should that hold, this would mark the lowest-scoring season since 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>OK, so guys aren't hitting home runs. What's to blame?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, let's first understand how home runs come to be.</p>\n<p>The lowest exit velocity on a home run this season was 93 mph. The launch angle on a ball can vary greatly. A <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30583/giancarlo-stanton\">Giancarlo Stanton</a> missile left the park on a 15-degree trajectory. A <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41433/jazz-chisholm-jr\">Jazz Chisholm Jr</a>. moon shot arced out at 45 degrees. All other 286 home runs in the first 10 games for each team fell within those parameters.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The sweet spot is somewhere between 20 and 35 degrees. More than 90% of home runs hit this season have left the bat at that angle. The percentage of balls hit 93 mph-plus with 20 to 35 degrees of launch have gone for home runs 29.8% of the time -- the lowest mark over the first 10 team games played since Statcast came to be and down from last year's 34.17%.</p>\n<p>A specific area is where the change is really happening, though. It's on balls hit between 100 and 102 mph at those same launch angles. Only 16.42% of such batted balls are going for home runs. Over the past seven years, that number has been 33.1%. That is not just an outlier. It means something is happening.</p>\n<p>The likeliest culprit: the ball itself. This is not a new story. A book could be written on the controversies surrounding the MLB ball and its inconsistencies. Such is life with a handmade product, sure, but when home runs are collapsing at similar rates to which they grew in 2019, the ball will face rightful scrutiny. Unlike any fear of nefarious juiced balls or using multiple specs in one season, this might have a less sinister answer: For the first time this season, all 30 teams are using humidors to store their balls. Humidors don't necessarily dampen the flight of balls; their benefit comes more from making the ball as uniform as possible.</p>\n<p>Perhaps as the weather and humidity levels change, so too will the home runs. In the meantime, the diminished rate is the clear and obvious story to emerge from the first two weeks of play. When the calendar turns to May, we'll have an even better idea if it was little more than an outlier that corrected itself or something that will have a profound effect on the 2022 season.</p>\n<p><strong>Are pitchers doing anything differently?</strong></p>\n<p>For years, pitchers have trended away from throwing fastballs, and this looks to be the season that it finally happens: Fastballs will no longer constitute a majority of pitches thrown. Of the more than 40,000 pitches thrown this season, only 48.3% have been fastballs -- down from 50.5% last season.</p>\n<p>The fastball has been replaced by its tilty, spinny cousin, the slider. Since 2015 -- a year in which fastballs made up a massive 56.8% of pitches thrown -- slider usage has jumped from 14.5% of pitches to 21.7% this year.</p>\n<p>The slider revolution is a reliever-driven endeavor. This season, bullpen arms are throwing it 26.1% of the time, compared to 17.3% from starters. The one-inning, max-out culture of modern baseball practically invites it -- and the jump among relievers from 21.9% slider usage in teams' first 10 games last season is no accident. Sliders have generated whiffs on 36.3% of swings, higher than the fastball (19.3%), cutter (26.5%), curveball (31.4%) and changeup (33.3%). Only the splitter, thrown by about 40 of the nearly 500 big leaguers who have pitched this season, has a higher whiff rate than the slider (39.8%).</p>\n<p><strong>Is that why relievers are throwing just as many innings as starters?</strong></p>\n<p>The average start thus far this season has lasted 4.53 innings. Barely half a game. There still hasn't been a complete game this year <strong>(</strong>the record for longest wait into the season is 20 days, set in 2019) The days of starters going deep into games is history, sure, but this is bordering on absurd.</p>\n<p>Now, it's important to note that the lockout-shortened spring training is partly to blame for this. But the ramp-up period before the COVID-shortened 2020 season was even briefer, and starters over their teams' first 10 games averaged 4.61 innings per contest. By the end of the season, that number jumped to 4.78 innings -- not a particularly meaningful leap but at least something. Last season, with a full spring training, starters in the first 10 games averaged 5.03 innings ... and finished the season at 5.02.</p>\n<p>The numbers thus far support teams' increasing use of relievers. The average starter's ERA: 4.27. Reliever's: 3.53 -- nearly three-quarters of a run better. Batters against starters are slashing .245/.319/.399 compared to .221/.307/.358 for relievers.</p>\n<p><strong>OK. So no one's hitting the ball out of the park and starters are barely throwing. What does all that mean for the big offseason signings so far?</strong></p>\n<p>There were 11 nine-figure deals this winter. Some are going swimmingly, and others are -- well, you'll see.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32691/corey-seager\">Corey Seager</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a>: He's been perfectly solid -- and already has a nomination for most confounding moment of 2022 after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> manager Joe Maddon walked him with the bases loaded in the fourth inning to give Texas a 4-2 lead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33172/kris-bryant\">Kris Bryant</a>, LF, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a>: The Rockies have the third-best record in baseball (and their division, thanks to the juggernaut <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and doing-it-again <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants\">San Francisco Giants</a>, and Bryant has acquitted himself rather well, hitting .359.

His opposite-field home run in his first plate appearance against his longtime team, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a>, set Dodger Stadium aflutter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28976/max-scherzer\">Max Scherzer</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a>: Scherzer has a 2.50 ERA, has struck out 23 in 18 innings, looks like he's primed for a huge year ... and has been the worst of the Mets' starters, who sport ERAs of 0.00 (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40921/david-peterson\">David Peterson</a>), 0.75 (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33148/chris-bassitt\">Chris Bassitt</a>), 0.84 (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28968/carlos-carrasco\">Carlos Carrasco</a>) and 2.20 (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/3332018/tylor-megill\">Tylor Megill</a>, who gave up his first runs of the season Tuesday).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32667/kevin-gausman\">Kevin Gausman</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>: Gausman has been BABIP'd to death, but his peripherals scream ace, with a 14-to-0 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 10⅔ homerless innings portending very well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32127/javier-baez\">Javier Baez</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a>: A bum right thumb landed him on the injured list, but Baez already won a game Opening Day with a walk-off single and another with a two-run homer. The Tigers are learning quickly: It's not always going to be pretty, but Baez is the sort of player you want on your team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31187/nick-castellanos\">Nick Castellanos</a>, OF, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>: With an OPS over .850, he's the bat the Phillies needed to not win the NL East for the 11<sup>th</sup> consecutive year.</p>\n<p><strong>So those big additions all seem to be going well. Which might have their fans a little nervous so far?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32146/marcus-semien\">Marcus Semien</a>, 2B, Texas Rangers: Among the 185 qualified players, his FanGraphs Wins Above Replacement of minus-0.2 ranks 179<sup>th</sup>. Thankfully, unlike the leaguewide trends, all it takes is a few big days at this point in the season to return the 31-year-old Semien to his MVP-level play.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32150/trevor-story\">Trevor Story</a>, 2B, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a>: After a protracted winter, Story signed a $140 million deal on the eve of the season and is still searching for his footing, with a .643 OPS in seven games.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a>: While his strikeout rate has doubled over last season's to 36.8%, Correa, like Story, got a late start this spring.

The former is far more concerning than the latter, as Ray has always been a home run machine, but he has generated a higher percentage of swings and misses with his heater this year than when won the American League Cy Young Award last season, so don't fret. Yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of new faces: I heard this rookie class was supposed to be an all timer. How's it doing?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4142424/seiya-suzuki\">Seiya Suzuki</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> has actually been the best rookie, but he's hardly a traditional prospect after starring in Japan. When offseason bidding wound up at $85 million, it was clear teams loved the 27-year-old outfielder. The Cubs are thrilled he loved them back. His seamless transition is exactly the sort of a thing upon which rebuilds are built.</p>\n<p>The best non-Suzuki rookie this year has been <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a>' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steven Kwan</a>, who has done nothing but hit in pro ball but still eluded all radars. The rest have been a mixed bag.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Here are the slash lines of some of the most highly touted prospects making their debuts: Kansas City's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42403/bobby-witt-jr\">Bobby Witt Jr</a>. (.139/.162/.250), Seattle's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41044/julio-rodriguez\">Julio Rodriguez</a> (.143/.231/.171), San Diego's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42402/cj-abrams\">C.J. Abrams</a> (.115/.233/.231), Philadelphia's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42417/bryson-stott\">Bryson Stott</a> (.133/.161/.167). The lesson: Baseball is really hard, even for the most talented players.</p>\n<p>There have been standouts aside from Kwan. Since starting 0 for 10, Detroit's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4424286/spencer-torkelson\">Spencer Torkelson</a> hit .400/.500/.867 over his next five games. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41273/jeremy-pena\">Jeremy Pena</a> looks like a natural taking over for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a> at shortstop in Houston. And what's there to say about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39635/hunter-greene\">Hunter Greene</a> aside from: Wow.</p>\n<p><strong>You seriously don't have anything more to say about Hunter Greene?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, for one: He is already the hardest-throwing starter in major league history. The 22-year-old has flung 113 fastballs and averaged 100 mph on the nose, bottoming out at 98 and topping 102, one of 59 triple-digit heaters he has unleashed this season.</p>\n<p>After going second in the 2017 draft out of the Los Angeles area, Greene tore his right ulnar collateral ligament in 2019 and missed the season. The rest of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a>' roster might leave something to be desired, but in Greene, the Reds have a 6-foot-5, 230-pound monolith whose fastball, for all its speed and splendor, may actually be his second-best pitch behind an 87-mph slider on which he still hasn't yielded a hit having thrown it 41 times.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Shame the Reds traded away all his teammates. Speaking of: What was the most important trade of the offseason?</strong></p>\n<p>With all due respect to Seattle acquiring <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32833/jesse-winker\">Jesse Winker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a> from Cincinnati, the Mets adding Bassitt and San Diego shoring up its bullpen with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33671/taylor-rogers\">Taylor Rogers</a>, Atlanta replacing Freeman with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32767/matt-olson\">Matt Olson</a> is the obvious choice, and not just because he's hitting .413/.534/.652 and leading the big leagues in WAR.</p>\n<p>The Braves recognize their window is larger than most teams because of the team-friendly contracts for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36185/ronald-acuna-jr\">Ronald Acuna Jr</a>. and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33783/ozzie-albies\">Ozzie Albies</a> that so deeply advantage them. Add to that their young starting pitching (Wright and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40916/ian-anderson\">Ian Anderson</a> among them) are under control for the next five seasons, plus four more years of third baseman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34982/austin-riley\">Austin Riley</a>, and Atlanta had the core and financial flexibility to add a star. As much as the Braves paid in prospects for Olson -- and pay they did -- turning around and locking him up for the next eight seasons guaranteed a thumper in the middle of their lineup for the prime of his career.</p>\n<p>This is Team Building 101 in modern baseball: Develop good players, hope they sign undermarket deals and add consequential players around them via trade, free agency or, as is Atlanta's case, both.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel like we're missing a lot of stars this season, right? Any idea when we'll get them back?</strong></p>\n<p>Correct. There's a case to be made that we haven't seen the three best players in the entire NL yet this season.</p>\n<p>Acuna played his first game Tuesday at Triple-A Gwinnett after blowing out his ACL last July and, health permitting, he'll be back at latest the first week of May, adding a top 5 player in the game to a team that's already plenty good without him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32796/jacob-degrom\">Jacob deGrom</a> will get another MRI on the stress reaction in his right shoulder blade Monday, and it's expected to offer some clarity into his return. The Mets are hopeful the best pitcher in baseball can return by late May, though their starters are doing quite all right without him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr\">Fernando Tatis Jr</a>. played Sunday. The sport was soccer, of course, and the fact that he wiped out on the field at Petco Park wasn't altogether reassuring to those who'd rather place him in a glass case and let a broken left wrist suffered in a motorcycle accident this winter heal. (His soccer slip wound up with him landing on his right side, it should be noted.) While Tatis' return date is unclear at this point, his return, like Acuna's and deGrom's, will be a welcome moment for the sport.</p>\n<p><strong>What about prospects? Anyone joining their big league squads soon?</strong></p>\n<p>Adley Rutschman and Grayson Rodriguez, C/SP, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a>: It's just a matter of time until the best one-two prospect punch in baseball arrives. Rutschman may have broken camp with the Orioles if not for a triceps injury, but he's expected to return any day now and join Rodriguez at Triple-A Norfolk. In two starts there, Rodriguez has struck out 15 in nine innings while walking just one.</p>\n<p>Triston Casas, 1B, Boston: Every day <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39382/bobby-dalbec\">Bobby Dalbec</a> struggles only increases the likelihood Casas will take over the Red Sox's first-base job sooner than later. At Triple-A Worcester, he's doing exactly what he's done in his previous stops: hit for immense power, show uncommon plate discipline and give Red Sox fans even more reason to be excited about the future.</p>\n<p>Corbin Carroll, CF, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>: He's not exactly on the timetable of Rutschman, Rodriguez or Casas, but Carroll is every bit their caliber as a player. While he has played just 57 games in the minor leagues and is currently at Double-A, his elite tools more than make up for his slight frame. Size in baseball matters not. All that's important is that you can play, and Carroll, 21, is a superstar in the making. The only question is whether Arizona, with no hopes of contending, will wait until next season to summon him.</p>\n<p>George Kirby, SP, Seattle Mariners: As if the Mariners didn't already have enough young, excellent starting pitching, Kirby has a chance to be the best of them all. Chosen No. 20 overall out of Elon in 2019, he wowed the organization at the team's alternate site in 2020, came out throwing 100 in 2021 and could contribute at the major-league level now if necessary.</p>\n<p>Max Meyer, SP, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a>: The Marlins' surfeit of young arms includes Meyer, the third pick in the 2020 draft, who has blazed his way to Triple-A and been nearly unhittable in two starts there. Between Meyer and Eury Perez, the 19-year-old at Double-A, Miami might have the best pair of starting pitching prospects in baseball. And keep an eye on shortstop Kahlil Watson, who slipped to the Marlins with the 16<sup>th</sup> pick in last year's draft and could move very quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of moving, how are the free-agents-to-be looking so far?</strong></p>\n<p>While this isn't seen as a great pitching class, Rodon, Bassitt, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34848/joe-musgrove\">Joe Musgrove</a> (1.42 ERA) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard\">Noah Syndergaard</a> (1.59 ERA) all have been excellent in their first two starts. The best player in the class, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a>, is doing Trea Turner things for the Dodgers: hitting for average, showing good pop, running faster than just about everyone and playing a solid shortstop. And in the vein of solid shortstops: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31606/xander-bogaerts\">Xander Bogaerts</a>, who is primed to opt out of the final three years of his deal with Boston, just keeps hitting. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32818/joey-gallo\">Joey Gallo</a> could use a taste of that hitterishness, as could <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33095/jose-abreu\">Jose Abreu</a>, who is due to break out any time now.</p>\n<p>Lest we not forget <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>, who is bound to be one of the biggest stories this season after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33697851/new-york-yankees-aaron-judge-new-contract-ahead-self-imposed-first-pitch-deadline\">turning down a seven-year, $213.5 million extension</a> offer from the New York Yankees on Opening Day. Through 11 games, Judge, who will turn 30 on April 26, has driven in a single run on a solo homer. More deep flies are bound to come, and when they do, it's bound to make a difficult decision for the Yankees -- pay up or let him walk like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/6204/robinson-cano\">Robinson Cano</a> -- that much harder.</p>\n<p><strong>Let's get down to business. I want to beat all the jobbers in my fantasy league. Whose early excellence is real?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34943/dylan-cease\">Dylan Cease</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a>: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/33630068/jeff-passan-2022-mlb-season-preview-predictions-every-possible-perspective\">I told you to grab him</a> at 25-1 for the AL Cy Young. He's now 8-1. The lesson, as always, is that if you listen to me you'll get rich.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33696/carlos-rodon\">Carlos Rodon</a>, SP, San Francisco Giants: Rodon has ditched his changeup and gone almost exclusively fastball-slider, which you can do when you sit 97 from the left side with the former and generate swings and misses from both sides with the latter. If his arm can hold up for the season, he's going to opt-out this winter and be a very, very rich man.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31261/nolan-arenado\">Nolan Arenado</a>, 3B, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a>: He has walked more than he has struck out. His power stroke is unimpeachable. The glove remains gilded. Arenado may be on the wrong side of 30, but after two seasons with ugly averages on balls in play, a return to .300 isn't out of the question.</p>\n<p><strong>Great. But those guys are long gone in a lot of fantasy leagues. Who are some players I might be able to snag before others catch on?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39652/kyle-wright\">Kyle Wright</a>, SP, Atlanta Braves: Sometimes breakouts take a little time. Wright, the fifth pick in the 2017 draft, is finally commanding his four-pitch mix, but it's his curveball that's the star of the show. He pitched twice in the Braves' World Series win last year out of necessity. This season, he's ready to be an integral part of their repeat attempt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41221/logan-gilbert\">Logan Gilbert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4894467/matt-brash\">Matt Brash</a>, SP, Seattle Mariners: Gilbert, 24, added across-the-board velocity to all of his secondary offerings and is looking the part of an ace. Brash, 23, might already have the best breaking ball in the big leagues two starts into his career. His slider mirrors the movement profile of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32185/blake-treinen\">Blake Treinen</a>'s nastiest-pitch-in-the-big-leagues candidate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41109/jhoan-duran\">Jhoan Duran</a>, RP, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a>: His fastball sits at 101 mph. His splinker -- a sinker held with a split-fingered grip -- is in the running for the nastiest pitch in baseball. Health permitting, he's going to be a dominant closer for a long, long time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40423/gavin-lux\">Gavin Lux</a>, 2B/OF, Los Angeles Dodgers: What, Trea Turner, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a>, Freddie Freeman, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38309/will-smith\">Will Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32900/chris-taylor\">Chris Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/29607/justin-turner\">Justin Turner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33912/cody-bellinger\">Cody Bellinger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33303/max-muncy\">Max Muncy</a> weren't enough? The trade of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30699/aj-pollock\">AJ Pollock</a> opened up an everyday spot for Lux, whose plate discipline (seven walks, six strikeouts in 37 plate appearances) and consistent hard contact -- 16 of 24 batted balls at 95 mph-plus -- scream star.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32155/cj-cron\">C.J. Cron</a>, 1B, Colorado Rockies: He plays in Denver. He's got light-tower power even on the road. And Colorado's got him for $7.25 million each of the next two years. Oh, and he's still 40-1 to lead the big leagues in home runs. That might be a stretch, but if the ball really is dead and home runs are more difficult to come by, the guy who plays half his games at Coors Field at very least stands a chance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33557/sean-murphy\">Sean Murphy</a>, C, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/oak/oakland-athletics\">Oakland A's</a>: When teams were picking at Oakland's carcass in trade talks this winter, they were told unequivocally that Murphy wasn't moving, even as he prepares to head into arbitration next winter. It's easy to understand why. Here are the five players with the hardest-hit balls this season: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> (119.1 mph), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>. (117.9), Giancarlo Stanton (116.8), Murphy (114), Aaron Judge (114). Not bad company. And I bet none of them <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCSAthletics/status/1514005706290122753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1514005706290122753%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcsports.com%2Fbayarea%2Fathletics%2Fsean-murphys-humorous-reaction-butt-going-viral-after-hit-pitch\">can twerk like Murphy</a>, either.</p>\n<p><strong>Okay, who's defying expectations -- for better or worse? List the most surprising things we <em>haven't</em> seen this season so far. </strong></p>\n<p>Aside from those two ticks on Robbie Ray's fastball:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32818/joey-gallo\">Joey Gallo</a> extra-base hit. The Yankees' prize last trade deadline has four hits in 33 at-bats -- and all of them have been singles.</li>\n<li>The giddy-up on Zack Wheeler's heater that almost won him the NL Cy Young last year with Philadelphia. His average fastball velocity is down nearly 2.5 mph and he bottomed out at 91.1 mph in his last start after sitting 97 last season.</li>\n<li>A couple mph on the fastballs of the Dodgers' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33223/julio-urias\">Julio Urias</a> and Twins' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35999/chris-paddack\">Chris Paddack</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33210/jp-crawford\">J.P. Crawford</a> striking out since Opening Day. The owner of a new $51 million contract has gone 36 consecutive plate appearances without a K, which qualifies as a minor miracle these days.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38904/bo-bichette\">Bo Bichette</a> walk. That's 49 plate appearances and counting.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34168/tyler-o'neill\">Tyler O'Neill</a> striking out like he typically does. He got punched in 31.3% of plate appearances last year. This season: 17.1%, with an improved walk rate, too.</li>\n<li>A dip in attendance. Perhaps it's a surprise that attendance compared to the first two weeks of 2019 -- the last season not affected by the pandemic -- is almost flat. In the 150 games played through Monday, the average attendance across MLB was 28,517. In the first 153 games played in 2019, the average attendance across MLB was 28,733. That's a 0.75% drop. Essentially, nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What's the most misleading stat so far?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a>' pitching staff has the slowest average fastball in MLB at 90 mph.</p>\n<p>When I saw this, it didn't make any sense. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41199/shane-mcclanahan\">Shane McClanahan</a>, who's on his way to the All-Star Game this year, sits 97. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42584/drew-rasmussen\">Drew Rasmussen</a> throws 96. Even though the Rays throw by far the fewest fastballs in the big leagues -- they're at 40.2% usage, with Pittsburgh second at 44.4% surely two starters with top 10 velocities would carry the day, right?</p>\n<p>Then I dug a little deeper, and the answer was so obvious. On April 11, Oakland was blowing out the Rays, and rather than waste his bullpen to pick up starter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41176/luis-patino\">Luis Patino</a> when he left the game after his 13<sup>th</sup> pitch with an oblique injury, manager Kevin Cash broke his in-case-of-emergency glass and called for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33822/brett-phillips\">Brett Phillips</a>.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>For 28 pitches, Phillips threw an oxymoronic fastball that registered, on average, 46.8 mph. So, yes, with Phillips, Tampa Bay is indeed the slowest-throwing team in the big leagues. Remove his 28 pitches from their numbers, though, and Tampa Bay's velocity gains more than 2 mph, up to 91.5 mph -- still a tick below the league average, still 27<sup>th</sup> in the big leagues, but certainly not the slowest.</p>\n<p><strong>Who hits fastballs better than any team in the AL?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, of course. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32078/george-springer\">George Springer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33377/teoscar-hernandez\">Teoscar Hernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman\">Matt Chapman</a> -- they all crush heaters. They crush pretty much everything, actually, and if you haven't had the pleasure of taking in one of their games yet, do yourself a favor. Among their lineup, their pitching staff (Gausman and big <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42436/alek-manoah\">Alek Manoah</a> especially have looked good) and their fan base that makes Rogers Centre one of the most intimidating places to play in baseball, Toronto has proven itself a more-than-worthwhile AL East contender.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you going to do the right thing and give Vlad Jr. his own answer?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, when you ask it like that, yeah, I guess I kind of have to, don't I?</p>\n<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>\n<p>Fine. Vlad Jr., still just 23, is a resplendent hitter. He punishes pitches that would tie up excellent big-league hitters. He hits for power. He hits for average. If he reverses his plate-discipline numbers -- his strikeouts are way up and his walks way down -- he'll even be in the conversation with Washington's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a> for the Best Hitter in Baseball title.</p>\n<p><strong>Best <em>hitter? </em>So Vlad Jr. isn't already the Best <em>Player</em> in Baseball?</strong></p>\n<p>No. That title still belongs to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>. Sorry. This isn't the sort of appellation that gets awarded with an interim title like in boxing. Trout missed much of the 2021 season because of a hamstring injury, and he's out now after getting hit on the left hand with a pitch, but it's not like some sort of long-term health crisis that's bound to affect the way he plays has befallen him.</p>\n<p>Until his game deteriorates -- and pre-injury this season he showed it hasn't -- or another player emerges with a clear multiyear run of better-than-Trout production, it's best to stop engaging in such foolishness. The Best Player in Baseball isn't the best player at any particular moment. It is someone who marries excellence with consistency, and all of the candidates right now are either too young, play the wrong position or both (Guerrero and Soto each apply) to suggest unequivocally they are ready to inherit the title. Maybe someday. Maybe soon, in fact. Both, along with Tatis and Acuna, are that damn good.</p>\n<p><strong>Uh, did you forget about Shohei Ohtani?</strong></p>\n<p>Aside from that whole consistent production-over-multiple-years thing, Ohtani is in perhaps the best position to snatch the title from Trout. Unlike his younger contemporaries, his production and positional value are the best in the sport.</p>\n<p>Never forget that Ohtani is doing two jobs at once as designated hitter and once-every-six-days starter for the Angels. It may well be a once-in-a-lifetime thing. For those who worried about his offensive slump to start the season, Ohtani slugged three home runs in a weekend series against Texas to pull his OPS over the league average. And even though his early ERA is 7.56 following a poor second start, Ohtani has added some juice to a fastball that already had a plenty-good combination of velo and movement. Someone else can bet against him turning it around.</p>\n<p>For all the (warranted) hype around Vlad Jr. and the return of Trout and the excellence of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32655/byron-buxton\">Byron Buxton</a> before the injury bug bit once again, the AL MVP award is Ohtani's to lose -- as it is every year he stays healthy. To deny him of it, provided he produces as he can, because of monotony or boredom or whatever excuse MVP voters may use to convince themselves against voting him, would be antithetical to the process that exists to reward the best player from that season.</p>\n<p>Trout, of course, could return from the hit-by-pitch on his left hand that sidelined him Monday and lay waste to any claim Ohtani has. That the two are on the same team only adds to the urgency to be more than mediocre, which has been the Angels' existence for more than a half-decade</p>\n<p>There is plenty of time for Los Angeles to reverse that -- more than another five-plus months, to be exact. The baseball season is just starting, just revealing its wonders, just preparing to let the fans who stuck around know that even if home runs are disappearing and even if starting pitchers aren't what they once were, there's still plenty to love.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>NEW YORK -- The average salary in the major leagues rebounded to $4.4 million on Opening Day, boosted by a frenzy of free-agent signings before and after the 99-day lockout, according to a study of baseball contracts by The Associated Press.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> pitcher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28976/max-scherzer\">Max Scherzer</a> set a season record at $43.3 million, topping the previous mark established last year by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> pitcher Trevor Bauer at $38 million.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>As spring training progressed and its typical optimism prevailed, a preposterous thought began to gain traction:</p>\n<p>What if <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> can actually be <em>better</em>?</p>\n<p>In other words: What if arguably the most impressive season in baseball history -- one that included a .965 OPS, 46 home runs and 26 stolen bases as a hitter, and a 3.18 ERA, 156 strikeouts and 130 1/3 innings as a pitcher -- was only the beginning?</p>\n<p>It's a consideration that might exist only amid the buoyancy that tends to permeate baseball facilities in March, when the season is new, nobody has lost and everybody reports to being in \"<a href=\"https://grantland.com/the-triangle/mlb-does-best-shape-of-his-life-spring-training-proclamation-matter/\">the best shape of my life</a>.\" But peel back the layers, and this wild premise might actually begin to make some sense.</p>\n<p>Plenty of Ohtani's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> teammates have thought about it.</p>\n<p>\"The ceiling is unbelievable,\" Angels center fielder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> said. \"You never know what he's gonna do.\"</p>\n<p>There have been only eight double-digit WAR seasons this century, based on FanGraphs' calculation: one each by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30112/buster-posey\">Buster Posey</a> and Randy Johnson, two by Trout and four by Barry Bonds, who got as high as 12.7 fWAR in 2002. Ohtani, 27, finished his unanimous 2021 MVP season with 8.1 fWAR. Many initially wondered about his ability to sustain such high levels of production, given the mental and physical demands of a two-way role in the major leagues. But what if there's actually even more upside?</p>\n<p>It's an unfair expectation, of course, but not an unreasonable one, considering Ohtani's unprecedented ability to add significant value on the mound, in the batter's box and on the basepaths (Angels manager Joe Maddon said he has no plans to limit Ohtani's stolen base attempts this season). It's also easy to identify reasons he might be even more productive in 2022. Here are three of them:<offer></offer></p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33574002/source-mlb-players-association-agree-rule-changes-including-keeping-automatic-runner-second-base-extras\">new rule</a>, borrowed from last year's All-Star Game, will allow Ohtani to remain in the lineup after he finishes pitching. Last year, in the 20 starts in which he also hit, Ohtani lost a combined 22 plate appearances to the old directive that forced the Angels to replace his spot in the lineup -- and he would've lost a handful more had he not moved from the mound to the outfield on seven occasions. Another new rule has brought the designated hitter to the National League. The Angels play 10 games in NL parks this season. That's roughly 50 more plate appearances for Ohtani, if he makes each start.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>The 2021 season was Ohtani's first time in six years as a full-time pitcher, and he very noticeably improved as it went along. The velocity arrived early, but the control came later. As his comfort grew, Maddon noticed significantly improved fastball command that played up his plus splitter and made his slider \"devastating,\" a development that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33695595/los-angeles-angels-shohei-ohtani-strikes-nine-hitless-plate-loss-astros\">spilled into his 2022 debut</a>. Ohtani went from walking 12.4% of hitters and posting a 3.49 ERA in the first half to walking 3.6% of hitters and posting a 2.84 ERA in the second half. He averaged 15 outs per start in April, May and June, and 19 in July, August and September.\n\n\n</li>\n<li>The Angels played without their two other best players -- Trout and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32098/anthony-rendon\">Anthony Rendon</a> -- for the entire second half last season. And down the stretch, the effects were felt by Ohtani, who got very little to hit and saw his numbers dip congruently. Ohtani drew 48 walks after the start of August, an AL-leading 14 of which were intentional (during a three-game stretch in late September, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a> combined to walk him 11 times in 15 plate appearances). His OPS fell by 86 points after Aug. 1. That might not have been the case if Trout and Rendon were healthy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's another, less tangible thought to consider: Ohtani has now done this for a full season, and that is no small thing. He knows what it looks like and feels like to navigate a complete major league schedule as a two-way player. How to prepare more efficiently. How to structure his bullpen sessions accordingly. How to separate his two jobs in general. As the 2021 season wore on, Angels catcher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30429/max-stassi\">Max Stassi</a> saw Ohtani become increasingly more acclimated to the rhythms of a two-way role. He \"got comfortable with how the flow of everything was going,\" Stassi said, \"and he just started to excel.\"</p>\n<p>\"The thing going into this year is he has the experience of doing that,\" said Stassi. \"You don't even want to throw any projections on him because you don't know how good this really could be.\"</p>\n<p>And so the question is: At full health, in this role, can anybody truly challenge Ohtani for an MVP? Can any single hitter or pitcher prove to be more valuable than a man who, at base level, brings value in ways that have not been replicated in more than a century? Or has Ohtani -- who reported feeling \"a lot stronger\" at the start of spring training, then had that show up in the form of a firmer fastball on Opening Day -- already graduated into MVP inevitability?</p>\n<p>All but one of the five main projection tools available on FanGraphs had Ohtani leading the AL in fWAR going into the season, projecting somewhere in the range of 6.1 and 7.1 fWAR. Another, The Bat, has Ohtani besting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a> for the major league lead. But Ohtani is not running away from the field in any projection. And others will undoubtedly make a push in 2022. Below, we identified the five men most likely to challenge Ohtani for this year's AL MVP.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels</strong></p>\n<p>At some point, as the sport continued to churn out young talent at breakneck speed, Mike Trout became part of the old guard. He's 30 now, and a father, and the 2022 season is his 12th in the major leagues.</p>\n<p>But there's no firm proof that Trout isn't still the very best player in the sport.</p>\n<p>While Ohtani cruised to the 2021 AL MVP award, Trout was sidelined by a calf injury that was more serious than expected and robbed him of the last four-plus months of the season. Before suffering that injury on May 17, Trout was batting .333/.466/.624. He feels fully healthy now and arrived in spring training focusing on his first-step reads in an effort to remain an everyday center fielder. Trout has been basically an average center fielder over the past three years, based on outs above average, but he has the athleticism to be better. If he can bolster his defense, and play in more than 140 games for the first time since 2016, he'll give Ohtani more competition than anyone.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>., <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a></strong></p>\n<p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr. said it himself on March 17:</p>\n<p>\"What we did last year was a trailer,\" he told reporters from his team's spring training complex in Dunedin, Florida. \"Now you guys are going to see the movie.\"</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Guerrero was talking about the young, hungry Toronto Blue Jays, who surged to 91 wins in the exceedingly difficult AL East in 2021 and look even better in 2022 -- but he might as well have been talking about himself.</p>\n<p>Last year, Guerrero led the majors in home runs (48) and paced the AL in on-base percentage (.401), slugging percentage (.601) and OPS+ (169). In any other year, Guerrero might have actually won the MVP award. But because Ohtani put together a season unlike any other, he didn't even receive a first-place vote.</p>\n<p>If we're going to entertain the possibility of more upside with Ohtani, we need to address the likelihood of more upside with Guerrero. He's only 23. What he did last year was well within the skill set many saw in him at a young age.

  "<p>TEMPE, Ariz. -- Spring training is moving unusually fast this year, and that is especially true at <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> camp. The possibility of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> moving off center field and into a corner-outfield spot lasted less than 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Angels manager Joe Maddon floated that as a possibility during his first media session on Sunday afternoon, explaining it as a better way to preserve Trout's body after he spent the past 4½ months last season recovering from a calf injury. But then Trout reported to camp on Monday morning and expressed a desire to remain at his natural position.</p>\n<p>That was enough.</p>\n<p>\"He's gonna play center field,\" Maddon said as the Angels navigated through their first official workout of spring training. \"That's that.\"</p>\n<p>Trout, who spoke to the media a couple of hours before Maddon's session, expressed surprise upon hearing the news on Sunday and had what he descried as a \"lengthy\" meeting with Maddon and Angels general manager Perry Minasian the following morning. In it, he reiterated his commitment to center field, at least for the foreseeable future, and also asked where he needs to improve to ensure that remains the case.</p>\n<p>\"I want to play center field, obviously,\" Trout said. \"We had a great conversation about it, and we'll go from there.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Trout, 30, is a three-time MVP who finished within the top five in voting for the American League award in each of his first nine seasons. During that stretch, from 2012 to 2020, Trout accumulated 74.8 FanGraphs wins above replacement; nobody else registered more than 47. But Trout's 2021 season was limited to 36 games in 2021 after he strained his right calf while running to third base on May 17 and never fully recovered.</p>\n<p>The initial timeline was six to eight weeks, but Trout, who was batting .333/.466/.624 before the injury, said his body \"wasn't healing right.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't really point to one thing,\" he added. \"We threw everything at it. And basically when I was shut down, I didn't do anything. I let it heal on its own for a few weeks. I got back into my training right away, and the first week, probably two weeks, I felt like a little tightness in there, and then it went away. I haven't thought about it since.\"</p>\n<p>Trout felt as if he had completely healed by the middle of October and eventually went through his normal offseason training. He reported Monday to having \"no setbacks\" and said this is \"the best I've felt in a while.\"</p>\n<p>\"I try to be the best player on the field at all times,\" Trout said. \"That's my mentality. The biggest thing, obviously, is staying healthy. And I'm gonna do everything I can to do that.\"</p>\n<p>A Gold Glove is the only major award Trout has yet to win, but he has come close in prior years. He ranked within the bottom 18% of qualified center fielders in outs above average three times in four years from 2016 to 2019, but he was 15th in 2018. Scouts have long stressed the need for him to improve on jumps and don't consider his arm a weapon, even though it has significantly improved since his rookie year. But Trout has always shown the explosiveness and physical skills to be a dynamic center fielder, a trait that has shown up in his assortment of robbed home runs.</p>\n<p>\"I feel comfortable out there,\" Trout said of center field. \"Natural.\"</p>\n<p>The Angels employ two promising young outfielders in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40854/jo-adell\">Jo Adell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40803/brandon-marsh\">Brandon Marsh</a>, the latter of whom would have been the front-runner to play center field. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28841/justin-upton\">Justin Upton</a>, who mostly plays left field, also remains with the team and is owed $28 million in 2022.</p>\n<p>The Angels' desire to move Trout isn't rooted in performance but more so on a desire to preserve his body and keep his bat in the lineup, considering Trout is owed nearly $320 million over the next nine years. Trout said Maddon might have briefly broached the subject of left field with him in the dugout last year. But that conversation -- if it even took place -- wasn't enough for Trout to spend time working out there during the offseason, when a 99-day lockout that lasted from the morning of Dec. 2 to Thursday afternoon prevented teams from communicating with their players.</p>\n<p>Maddon blamed the lockout for the lack of communication but said they cleared it up quickly.</p>\n<p>\"We talked about it -- he's fine,\" Maddon said. \"He and I have spoken about it in the past. He belongs out there. As long as he feels good, he belongs out there. We feel good about it. He said he feels in great shape, and he's eager to get back out there, so I'm happy about that.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

He won 30 games four times, led the NL five times in ERA and strikeouts, and was one of the five original inductees into the Hall of Fame in 1936. Mathewson relied on impeccable control and a pitch he called a \"fadeaway,\" which some say was a screwball while others suggest might have been more like a modern-day circle change. \"Matty was master of them all,\" reads his Hall of Fame plaque. -- <em>David Schoenfield</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>24.

Johnson won his league strikeout crown nine times, including two different stretches of four straight. During the latter stretch, he won four straight Cy Young Awards, giving him five overall.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best expressions of Johnson's dominance came during a pair of All-Star Game matchups with left-handed stars. In 1993, his wild pitch over the head of John Kruk had Kruk faking heart palpitations as the dugout erupted in laughter; after that, Kruk wouldn't go near the plate, striking out. In 1997, Larry Walker flipped his batting helmet around and switched to the right side of the plate after getting a look at a Johnson pitch. It was all in good fun, but also an indication of how fearsome Johnson looked to anyone who stepped into the batter's box against him. -- <em>Bradford Doolittle</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>23.

Henderson stole 50% more bases than the all-time runner-up, Lou Brock. Henderson hit 81 leadoff home runs, and nobody else has hit more than 54. After being traded to the Yankees, he was asked about wearing the same uniform Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle once donned. \"I don't care about them,\" he said. \"I never saw DiMaggio and Mantle play.

Denton True Young dominated the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, putting up numbers that to the modern eye just don't look real. You could fill a book with a list of them, but here's one: Young had 19 seasons in which he completed at least 30 games. The active career leader in that category is Adam Wainwright -- with 27.

Hornsby boasts the third-highest career batting average, behind only Ty Cobb and Oscar Charleston. He hit over .400 three times, including .424 in 1924. Two years earlier, he combined a .401 batting average with 42 home runs, an accomplishment no player has ever matched.

He stood close to the plate, his head hanging over it, daring pitchers to come inside. In his six seasons as leader of the Orioles, they won four pennants and two World Series. What was his impact?

Power bat, elite reflexes in the field and a strong throwing arm. No one combined these traits better or longer at the hot corner than Schmidt did during a career of near uniform excellence. Schmidt wasn't quite a three-true-outcomes player, as he did have seasons with solid batting averages, but he did put up prodigious numbers in homers (seven times leading the NL), walks (four times in the lead) and strikeouts (also four times in the lead).

He hit in 56 straight games, arguably baseball's most famous record. He played in 10 World Series in his 13 seasons -- and the Yankees won nine of them. Hemingway mentioned him (\"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,\" the old man said. \"They say his father was a fisherman.\"). Songs were written in his tribute.

Twenty-four players were selected before Trout in the 2009 draft, but three years later, the product of Millville, New Jersey, recorded perhaps the best rookie season of all time. His 10.5 bWAR that year (2012) is the record for a position player. He already has won three MVP trophies and finished in the top five of MVP balloting for nine straight years, a streak that ended last season because of injury.

Maddux won four consecutive Cy Young Awards from 1992 to 1995, while joining John Smoltz and Tom Glavine to form a devastating rotation on dominant Braves teams. He accumulated an NL-best 37 complete games during that stretch. In five of those, he allowed zero runs and threw fewer than 100 pitches. There's a term for that -- it's called a \"Maddux.\" All told, he is the only pitcher to combine 300-plus wins, 3,000-plus strikeouts and fewer than 1,000 walks. -- <em>Alden Gonzalez</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>13.

Junior reached the majors at 19, played alongside his dad in the Mariners outfield, wore his cap backward and made imagination-defying leaping grabs at the wall. Mostly, however, he hit home runs with the most beautiful swing you'll ever see. He led his league four times, including back-to-back seasons of 56. We can only imagine that final home run number if he had stayed healthy after leaving Seattle. Some will argue he's too high on this list; don't tell that to kids of the '90s. -- <em>David Schoenfield</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>12.

If Wagner were a young player today, he would be an odd sight. He was stockily built, with wide shoulders, a barreled chest, bowed legs and huge hands. Yet he did everything well: superb defense, elite average (eight batting titles), elite power (six slugging percentage titles) and was one of the best baserunners ever (723 steals, 252 triples). All that said, Wagner might be best known today for his rare baseball card that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/32031670/t206-honus-wagner-baseball-card-sells-6606-million-shattering-previous-record\">recently sold for more than $6 million</a>. -- <em>Bradford Doolittle</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>11.

His two best years, 1999 and 2000, came at the height of one of the highest-scoring eras in history. Martinez won the AL Cy Young Award after both those seasons, combining for a 1.90 ERA in 430 1/3 innings. The major league average in that stretch: 4.62. In 2000, he registered a 291 ERA plus -- an adjusted stat accounting for ballparks and era, with the average being 100 -- that stands as the best since at least 1893. -- <em>Alden Gonzalez</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>10.

And hitting .300 is what Musial did year after year. He topped the mark in each of his first 17 seasons in the big leagues, winning seven batting titles. His 1948 MVP season (his third MVP award) is one of the best ever: .376/.450/.702, 39 home runs, 18 triples, 46 doubles (that's 103 extra-base hits). He's second all-time in total bases, third in runs created (behind Barry Bonds and Babe Ruth) and in the top 10 in numerous other categories. He hit from an awkward-looking, hunched-over stance, but it worked: He was The Man. -- <em>David Schoenfield</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>9.

Estimates of how hard Johnson threw are all over the place, but we can safely say that at the very least, for his time he was off the charts. To the velocity, you can add a side-whipping, almost underhand arm slot, and hitters of his time had no chance. Today's hitters might not fare much better against peak Johnson. The numbers he compiled are staggering. Of them, perhaps the most illustrative of Johnson's dominance is his 110 shutouts -- 20 more than any other pitcher. -- <em>Bradford Doolittle</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>8.

He was a five-tool, Hall of Fame-caliber outfielder even before his neck widened and his numbers inflated, posting a .981 OPS while averaging 33 home runs and 34 stolen bases on the way to three MVPs from 1987 to 1998. Then Bonds became superhuman after allegedly starting to use PEDs. He broke the single-season home run record, passed Hank Aaron to become baseball's new home run king and put up these numbers from 2001 through 2004, his ages 36 to 39 seasons: 1.368 OPS (292 points higher than the runner-up), 209 home runs (17 more than the runner-up), 755 walks (307 more than the runner-up). -- <em>Alden Gonzalez</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>7.

He combined breathtaking raw power from both sides of the plate -- did he really hit a 565-foot home run? -- with blazing speed, at least until his knees went bad. He won a Triple Crown in 1956 and won three MVP awards -- and frankly could have won a few more (he led the AL nine times in offensive WAR). He hit 18 home runs in the World Series. Let's see somebody break that record. Asked if he went up to the plate trying to hit home runs, Mantle said, \"Sure, every time.\" -- <em>David Schoenfield</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>6. Lou Gehrig</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Team(s):</strong> New York Yankees (1923-39)</p>\n<p><strong>Stats: </strong>.340/.447/.632, 493 HR, 1,995 RBI, 2,721 H, 113.7 bWAR</p>\n<p><strong>Primary position: </strong>First base</p>\n<p><strong>What he's best known for: </strong>Society remembers Gehrig for the disease that took his life and bears his name, and for the courage he displayed when facing it. From a strictly baseball standpoint, the \"Iron Horse\" is remembered as a constant, a player who showed up every day and produced at a level few have. His legendary consecutive-games streak of 2,130 is his most-cited statistic and is the number responsible for turning the name of poor Wally Pipp, Gehrig's predecessor with the Yankees, into a verb. The yin to Babe Ruth's yang, Gehrig was perhaps baseball's best RBI man. His 1,995 ribbies rank seventh all-time despite the abrupt end to his career. -- <em>Bradford Doolittle</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>5. Ted Williams</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Team(s): </strong>Boston Red Sox (1939-42, 1946-60)</p>\n<p><strong>Stats: </strong>.344/.482/.634, 521 HR, 1,839 RBI, 2,654 H, 122.1 bWAR</p>\n<p><strong>Primary position: </strong>Left field</p>\n<p><strong>What he's best known for:</strong> Williams was probably the greatest hitter who ever lived, largely because of the astronomical numbers he put up but also because of how he revolutionized the approach to hitting. His book, \"The Science of Hitting,\" came out in 1970 and is still referenced frequently today, preaching modern-day concepts such as swinging with a slight uppercut, letting the hips lead and focusing on the parts of the strike zone where hitters can do the most damage. Williams boasts the highest on-base percentage in baseball history and is the last hitter to reach a .400 batting average. At ages 39 and 40, in 1957 and '58, he won the AL batting title. And his career totals could have been even higher had he not missed three prime seasons to serve in World War II. -- <em>Alden Gonzalez</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>4.

He played a game where you had to outthink the opponent, not outslug. Nearly 100 years since he played his final game, the image of Cobb remains vivid: the sharpened spikes, the aggression, the fiery temperament. Through the years, it became difficult to separate fact from fiction. \"They were all against me,\" Cobb wrote in his autobiography. \"But I beat the bastards down and left them in the ditch.\" Babe Ruth put it this way: \"Cobb is a p---k. But he sure can hit. God Almighty, that man can hit.\" -- <em>David Schoenfield</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>3.

Even today, if you ask a lifelong baseball fan how many homers Aaron hit, they'll probably be able to tell you. You ask how many Barry Bonds hit, and they might have to whip out their smartphone. When Aaron's pursuit of Babe Ruth's career homer record culminated in No. 715 on April 8, 1974, it was an iconic event in American history. And yet, Aaron was not really a home run hitter. He was a great hitter, period, as evidenced by his .305 lifetime average and 3,771 hits. Aaron's 2,297 RBIs remain the career record, one that is probably safe for a long time to come. When Aaron died just over a year ago, he was even more lauded <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30759337/hank-aaron-lasting-impact-measured-more-home-runs\">for his presence off the field</a>.

It's a play known simply as \"The Catch,\" and it epitomized Mays -- the athleticism, the grace, the ingenuity. Mays went on to win 12 Gold Gloves, but he was also an elite hitter, averaging 40 home runs per season from 1954 through 1966. And he ran with the best of them, leading the majors in stolen bases for four straight years from 1956 to 1959. His unmatched collection of skills made him the greatest center fielder who ever lived. -- <em>Alden Gonzalez</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>1.

The baseball we watch today is Babe Ruth's game. Many players make an impact, a few become folk heroes, but nobody changed a sport like Ruth did when he joined the Yankees and transformed baseball into a game of power. No player dominated his era like Ruth. He led his league in home runs 12 times, often out-homering entire teams, and 13 times in slugging and OPS. He slugged .690 ... for his <em>career</em>. He slugged .744 in 41 World Series games. He won all three of his World Series starts as a pitcher, one of them 14 innings. He called his shot. Or maybe he didn't.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>NEW YORK -- Three days into the MLB lockout, when  <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> fan Ray Sbarra checked Reddit for his baseball fix, he came up empty. So, with the lockout leaving the hot stove freezing cold and no end in sight, he decided to fill in the gap.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I just figured, let me make a stupid little drawing of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a>,\" said Sbarra, a 26-year-old former truck driver from Staten Island.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Sbarra -- whose art training begins and ends with elementary school -- picked up pen and paper and started drawing. As best he could, he created a picture of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a> superstar making a diving catch and posted it on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/r8wliz/drawing_mike_trout_every_day_until_the_lockout_is/\">the r/baseball subreddit</a> with the username \"DidItForTheStory\" and the title \"Drawing Mike Trout every day until the lockout is over. Day 1.\" Sbarra chose Trout because he wanted to draw the best player in the sport.</p>\n\n\n<p>Just like that, Sbarra started a mini sensation, a daily series that has drawn between 5,000 and 20,000 upvotes and hundreds of comments daily, giving baseball fans a sliver of joy during a long, uneventful offseason.</p>\n\n\n<p>Within hours, the drawing shot to the top of the page, with more than 10,000 upvotes and comments like \"oh dear god end the lockout\", \"Hopefully his art can change the world\" and \"I hope this is one of the banners outside the stadium next season (if there is a season).\"</p>\n\n\n<p>On the first six days, Sbarra replicated existing photos of Trout on the baseball field, but by the end of the initial week, he wanted to shake things up. Instead of another traditional baseball pose, Sbarra drew the Angels outfielder robbing a home run alongside the rocket from Blue Origin, the space company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. On the eighth day, he recreated the cover of the Nirvana album \"Nevermind\" with Trout substituting in as the baby.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"From there, it was like, what else can Mike Trout do?\" Sbarra said. \"He could do anything when you're drawing. Mike Trout can be anywhere, could be anyone.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>He started getting requests, with the top ask being a drawing of Trout as a fish. He complied, sketching up an image of a fish wearing a Trout jersey with a fishing line tied to Trout. In the following days, he's drawn Trout as Thomas the Tank Engine, as E.T. sitting in the basket of teammate Shohei Ohtani's bike and as Bruce Willis in \"Die Hard\" in addition to recreations of famous paintings and other iconic movie moments.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p>\"It's just really whatever I feel like doing that day,\" Sbarra said. \"I don't really have an idea of what it's going to be until I sit down to draw. I'll maybe Google a few reference images. Maybe today, I want to reference a famous painting so I'll Google famous paintings and I'll see one where I could see Mike Trout in it. There's endless possibilities.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>As a novice artist, Sbarra is slowly learning techniques and receiving constructive criticism. He spends an hour every day devoted to the drawings and tries to post them between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET. He's learning how to shade and more accurately scale people in his drawings. The most useful reply was a tip on how to draw the Angels logo, something he struggled with in his early drawings. In front of his daily audience on r/baseball, Sbarra wants to keep getting better at drawing.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It's really strange,\" Sbarra said. \"I also think everyone's having a fun time with it, and that's what makes it fun for me. I feel like I'm starting to develop a style.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p>What has kept him going is seeing the positive feedback he receives, with people posting pictures that their kids have drawn inspired by his art journey. None of the people in Sbarra's life know about this project -- he'd hoped to keep his name hidden for as long as possible because he did not want to overthink the drawings.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I didn't want to put pressure on me to either keep going or not keep going,\" Sbarra said. \"I just felt like if I could just do this without any input from anybody around me, I would be able to get it done. But now, you know, it's out there now. We'll keep going. We're not stopping.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Sbarra also hopes that drawing Trout can help spread his love and joy for baseball.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I've seen a lot of people post about how they didn't know who Mike Trout was because they only casually followed baseball, which I think is a travesty,\" Sbarra said. \"If you don't follow basketball, you know LeBron. You don't follow golf, you know Tiger Woods. More people should know who he is. A lot of people said they're going to check them out. At least a few new baseball fans, hopefully.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p>Sbarra said he is currently thinking about starting an online store to sell prints and t-shirts to raise money for charity, sending a percentage of proceeds to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a charity that Trout publicly supports, and the Center for Asian American media for any drawings that also feature Ohtani. A league source told ESPN that Trout is aware of the ongoing art series, but Trout did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n\n<p>This hobby-turned-Reddit-sensation started because Sbarra wanted more baseball in his life, but he hopes the project ends sooner than later so he can go back to following the sport he loves.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I hope [Trout] doesn't think it's weird,\" Sbarra said. \"I hope he likes it. I will be entertained if he has seen them. You know, I just hope to see him play a full season.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>About 15 minutes before first pitch of a Nationals-Braves game last summer, one of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a>'s sprints took him into the outfield, out behind second base, and he paused to say hi to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33783/ozzie-albies\">Ozzie Albies</a>, who talks to everyone, and after a moment, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36185/ronald-acuna-jr\">Ronald Acuña Jr.</a> joined in, listening more than talking.</p>\n<p>Baseball endures partly because generational threads are extended, and in watching Soto and Acuña engage, it's easy to wonder about how Willie Mays and Henry Aaron shared similar moments in the Polo Grounds, or when Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio said hello near the batting cage or in the hallways underneath Yankee Stadium. Mays and Aaron were both born and raised in Alabama, Mays just 2½ years older. Acuña and Soto were born less than a year apart. Williams and DiMaggio were sons of California, southern and northern, respectively.</p>\n<p>Soto and Acuña look as if they are going to be the Mays and Aaron, the Williams and DiMaggio of their age group -- all-time great talents who take turns dominating baseball's landscape. Soto's searing plate discipline is much like that of Williams, who thought it something of a sin to consciously hack at a pitch outside of the strike zone -- and who viewed his showdown with pitchers in personal terms, as Soto does. DiMaggio was generally the better all-around player than Williams, just as Acuña has a wider breadth of talents than Soto.</p>\n<p>Trying to rank Acuña and Soto as part of the Top 10 player rankings for each position feels almost as impossible as comparing Aaron and Mays or Williams and DiMaggio. Maybe the Nationals can take pity on a lowly sportswriter and shift Soto back to left field to ease this process.</p>\n<p>Soto is the more refined hitter, leading the league in walks last season with 145; only two other players even got to 100. But Acuña is improving, clearly. Acuña is a better right fielder, throws better, runs better, but Soto's dominance as a hitter is so unusual that his offense could more than offset any flaws in other parts of his play. Think about this: Acuña was leading all National League position players in fWAR (4.2) at the time of his season-ending injury on July 10 -- and 47 days would go by before eventual NL MVP <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30951/bryce-harper\">Bryce Harper</a> passed him. Acuña is the first player since DiMaggio, ESPN's Paul Hembekides reports, to score at least 300 runs and hit at least 100 homers through his first 400 career games.</p>\n<p>But the list of elite right fielders only starts with those two. Harper plays the position. So does <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a>, who finished second for NL MVP in 2020. And <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>, who could be the next $300 million player.</p>\n<p>No position is quite as stacked as right field in MLB these days, and Acuña and Soto are at the top of the heap. Here are the top 10 outfielders at each of the three spots, based on feedback from evaluators, as well as Hembekides and Sarah Langs of MLB.com.<offer></offer></p>\n<p><img class=\"imageLoaded\" src=\"http://espn.go.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Top 10 right fielders</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

Juan Soto, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a></strong></p>\n<p>With three-plus years of service time, Soto is now likely three years away from free agency. He'll hit the open market at 26, probably with some of the best numbers we've ever seen for a position player.

Cohen loves art, and in New York, outbidding George Steinbrenner's son for the best hitter in baseball would represent his pièce de résistance.</p>\n<p>Soto is represented by Scott Boras, who almost always takes his clients into free agency.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Mike Trout, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a></strong></p>\n<p>When Trout went down with a calf injury, he was off to the best start of what is already an exceptional career. With enhanced command of the strike zone, Trout generated a slash line of .333/.466/.624 in his first 36 games and then didn't play again. He is 30 years old now, and the Angels' priority will be his offense -- and the up-and-coming <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40803/brandon-marsh\">Brandon Marsh</a> is considered an elite center fielder. It'll be interesting to see when the conversation begins about Trout moving to a corner.</p>\n<p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30830/starling-marte\">Starling Marte</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a></strong></p>\n<p>He tied with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38980/bryan-reynolds\">Bryan Reynolds</a> for most fWAR among center fielders last season -- while playing 39 fewer games than Reynolds. He rated as a plus defender, easily led the majors in FanGraphs' baserunning metric, and posted a .383 on-base percentage. The top of the Mets' lineup could be dynamic, with Marte leading off.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Bryan Reynolds, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a></strong></p>\n<p>At 26 years old, he's an elite offensive player and drawing trade interest from rival clubs watching the Pirates go through a rebuild. Just as Cleveland faced a seemingly perpetual quandary about when to trade <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor\">Francisco Lindor</a>, the Pirates will have to decide if and when the time is right to flip Reynolds for younger trade assets. Reynolds has dramatically altered his ground ball/fly ball ratio, from 1.56 in his rookie season of 2019 to 1.10 last year.</p>\n<p><strong>4. George Springer, Toronto Blue Jays</strong></p>\n<p>He played a little less than half of the season, and in those 78 games, he had 42 extra-base hits and scored 59 runs -- and Toronto's record in the games in which he participated was 48-30.</p>\n<p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39631/luis-robert\">Luis Robert</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a></strong></p>\n<p>Injuries limited him to 68 games last year, but even in that relatively small sample, he demonstrated what a superstar he is likely to be -- Robert posted a slash line of .338/.378/.567, with an OPS+ of 155. He could be vying with Trout at the top of this list next year.</p>\n<p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35578/cedric-mullins\">Cedric Mullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a></strong></p>\n<p>He's one of the coolest stories in the majors, having worked his way from a 13th-round draft pick out of Campbell University to a big league All-Star. As they might say in the NBA, he fills a line score -- he had 72 extra-base hits last season, scoring 91 runs and winning a Silver Slugger Award, stealing 30 bags along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33912/cody-bellinger\">Cody Bellinger</a>, Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>As Bellinger foundered last summer and some agents began to speculate whether the Dodgers might not tender him a contract, a highly ranked executive shot that idea down quickly. No matter how bad Bellinger looks now, the exec said, he has too much talent for the Dodgers to not bet on the young slugger to figure out something -- and, on top of that, Bellinger will not be a total loss because he can bear so much value as a baserunner and a defender. The Dodgers worked out a one-year, $17 million deal with Bellinger for 2022.</p>\n<p>The working theory has been that Bellinger needs a full, healthy offseason to rediscover his swing -- which was certainly lost last year. His year-to-year production is mind-boggling. His wRC+:</p>\n<p>2019: 161 (5th best)<br>\n2020: 113 (67th)<br>\n2021: 48 (223rd among 224 players with at least 350 PA)</p>\n<p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32655/byron-buxton\">Byron Buxton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a></strong></p>\n<p>At a time when it feels that management and players seem completely at odds in assessing value -- re: the collective bargaining agreement talks -- the Twins and Buxton threaded a very fine needle collaboratively in working out a long-term deal that both accounts for his extraordinary talent and extensive injury history. Buxton is guaranteed to make at least $100 million, but that number will grow if he can stay on the field and trigger some incentive clauses. At his best, he is a dynamic force.</p>\n<p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32512/ketel-marte\">Ketel Marte</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a></strong></p>\n<p>Had he been healthy last season, when the Diamondbacks demonstrated they were very willing to weigh trades of their best players, it would have been interesting to see what kind of offers Marte would have received. He could be an impact player on a contending team.</p>\n<p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31358/enrique-hernandez\">Enrique Hernandez</a>, Boston Red Sox</strong></p>\n<p>He played three spots for Boston manager Alex Cora last year, but the bulk of his work was in center field -- and even before his blistering postseason performance, when he had 10 extra-base hits in 48 plate appearances against the Rays and Astros, Hernandez had already demonstrated he was worth more than the two-year, $14 million deal he got from the Red Sox. Hernandez isn't necessarily a graceful defender, like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31446/kevin-kiermaier\">Kevin Kiermaier</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32362/jackie-bradley-jr\">Jackie Bradley Jr</a>., but the metrics show he is well above average.</p>\n<p><strong>Honorable mention</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35062/harrison-bader\">Harrison Bader</a>, St. Louis Cardinals.

He had a .379 OBP with the Rangers at the time the Yankees acquired him, and by batting him in the No. 1 spot -- or one of the bottom three spots -- Aaron Boone could rescue him from having to bat with runners in scoring position early in games, moments that fueled the boos he heard. Last season, Gallo hit .162 with runners on base, .240 when he led off innings. The first part of the 2022 season could be crucial in determining whether Gallo is a fit for the market or, like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32082/sonny-gray\">Sonny Gray</a>, might be more comfortable elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30043/michael-brantley\">Michael Brantley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a></strong></p>\n<p>He has batted .300 or better in four consecutive seasons, pushing his career average to .298. Within a couple of years, he'll start to come within range of 2,000 hits and 1,000 career runs, which would be remarkable achievements considering all of the injuries that he dealt with in the prime of his career.</p>\n<p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31283/christian-yelich\">Christian Yelich</a>, Milwaukee Brewers</strong></p>\n<p>He won the MVP in 2018 and finished second the following year, and just hasn't been the same player since breaking a kneecap in September 2019. As Sarah Langs noted, Yelich's underlying data suggests that he's still hitting the ball hard -- but there are other issues.</p>\n<p>Yelich's rate of hard-hit balls was 49.1% in 2019. Last year: 48.8%. However, Yelich hit .189 against sliders and curveballs in 2021, after batting .191 against those pitches in 2020. Per Langs, in a note last summer: \"From 2019 to 2020, he had a huge drop-off in swing rate (45.2% to 34.6%), which was the largest in MLB. He just stopped swinging as often, and that seemed to hurt him. It was back a bit in 2021, to 41.4%, but still a bit lower. He swung at 29.7% of first pitches in '19, 13.4% in '20 and 22.5% in '21, so not fully back there.\"</p>\n<p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30699/aj-pollock\">AJ Pollock</a>, Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></p>\n<p>Even in a season in which he was sidelined by injury, Pollock had the highest OPS+ of his career, at 137, with a .297/.355/.536 slash line.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>The Hall of Fame has been at a crossroads for more than a decade now due to uncertainty on how to consider what I call the PED Five, which sounds like an outlaw gang that used to rob stagecoaches and saloons in Dodge City: Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Rafael Palmeiro. A group that has now been extended to also include Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>To make the Hall of Fame debates even more disorienting, in recent years the various veterans committees have grown exceedingly -- what's the right term here? -- magnanimous in their selections. Don't get me wrong, Jack Morris, Lee Smith, Harold Baines, Jim Kaat, Tony Oliva and Gil Hodges were all excellent ballplayers and it will be especially enjoyable to see Kaat and Oliva, both in their 80s, get enshrined this summer. It's also fair to say that none of these players <em>raised</em> the overall level of the Hall of Fame. Kaat has the highest career WAR of that group at 50.5 -- a total exceeded by 18 of the 30 players on this year's ballot.</p>\n<p>Before you jump on my case, no, it's not the Hall of WAR. That's just one barometer to consider, although career value and statistics have generally been the talking points for a player's candidacy -- not fame or popularity or even contributions made in the postseason.</p>\n<p>In a sense, the lack of a clear bar has turned some fans off on the whole process, myself included. I'm still a couple years away from voting eligibility, but my general philosophy would be as follows:</p>\n<p>(1) The Hall has elected Bud Selig, John Schuerholz, Pat Gillick, Bobby Cox, Joe Torre and Tony La Russa -- all of whom enabled, ignored or simply didn't care about PEDs in baseball. I don't see how you can put Bud Selig in the Hall of Fame after he presided over the sport during the steroid era and not Barry Bonds.</p>\n<p>(2) Does this player raise the average level of the Hall of Fame?</p>\n<p>With that second factor in mind, there is one follow-up question to ask: Who is the best player at each position not currently in the Hall of Fame? Each candidate shouldn't be analyzed in isolation. So let's look at the best players not currently in Cooperstown at each position:</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Catcher: Yadier Molina</h2>\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>2029</p>\n<p>Molina confirmed late last season that 2022 would be his final season, making him eligible for the 2028 ballot. I'm not sure he's an automatic first-ballot selection, so I have him going in a year later.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Joe Mauer, Buster Posey, Jorge Posada</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Early in their careers, Mauer and Posey both looked like potential inner-circle Hall of Famers -- elite offensive catchers with Gold Glove-caliber defense. Both won MVP Awards and Posey added three World Series championships his first five seasons with the Giants. Molina, meanwhile, looked like the next Tom Pagnozzi or Mike Matheny early on in St. Louis. He didn't break out at the plate until well into his career and he's remained one of the most durable backstops of all time. Indeed, he's caught more games than Mauer and Posey <em>combined</em> -- and Hall of Fame voters have long preferred longevity over peak value.</p>\n<p>Including Posada, who has the best career counting stats of the group with 275 home runs and 1,065 RBIs, each player has a significant roadblock to overcome, however:</p>\n<p>Molina: The worst hitter of the four, his career OPS+ of 97 means he's been a below-average hitter over his career (not to mention his lack of speed on the bases).</p>\n<p>Posey: I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/32545582/where-buster-posey-stands-all-great-catchers\">Posey's Hall of Fame case</a> when he retired back in November, but with just 1,371 career games he would easily have the shortest MLB career of any Hall of Fame position player since Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella.<br>\n<br>\nMauer: He has the highest career WAR of the four at 55.2, but played fewer than 50% of his career games at catcher.</p>\n<p>Posada: He had a poor defensive reputation and his career WAR of 42.7 is hardly a separator.</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind -- the bar for Hall of Famers is different depending on your position. Catchers don't play as many games, they get beat up, and so much of what they do isn't captured in the stats that go into WAR (at least the Baseball-Reference version). If you don't elect any of these four, you'll go an entire post-Mike Piazza/Ivan Rodriguez generation without any Hall of Fame catchers, which doesn't seem fair.</p>\n<p>Mauer hits the ballot for the 2024 election and Posey in 2027, so it's possible either or both get in before Molina, but I feel Molina is the best candidate, or at least the easiest for whom to forecast a path to Cooperstown. In a sense, Molina is the Ozzie Smith of catchers -- maybe the best ever defensively at his position; it won't matter that he wasn't a great hitter and it's clear WAR doesn't tell the whole story of his value to the Cardinals. How about this: All three get elected the same year. As for Posada, he's already off the ballot, so he would have to be a Veterans Committee selection (he should get in when Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera are on the committee).</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>No effect. A.J. Pierzynski is the only catcher on the ballot.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>First base: Albert Pujols</h2>\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>2028</p>\n<p>Pujols apparently wants to play in 2022 and given that he mashed against lefties in 2021 (.294/.336/.603), maybe some team gives him a chance as a platoon DH/bat off the bench. There isn't much of a role for a player of that ilk in this era, but let's say he gets in some games somewhere and then retires after the season, putting him on the 2028 ballot.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Miguel Cabrera, Joey Votto, McGwire, Palmeiro, Keith Hernandez, Todd Helton, Dick Allen, Fred McGriff.</p>\n<p>When Pujols left the Cardinals after the 2011, it appeared he would eventually pass Lou Gehrig as the greatest first baseman of all time and maybe even finish as one of the top 10 players. He was at 86.6 career WAR and entering his age-32 season, putting him 27.1 WAR behind Gehrig. Not a sure thing, but certainly doable. It didn't happen, of course, and Pujols is at 99.6 WAR, still one of the top 20 or 25 players ever.</p>\n<p>Note that I have Dick Allen way down the list here. There was much consternation when Allen fell one vote short of election in the recent Veterans Committee selection and, yes, Pujols, Cabrera and Votto are not yet eligible, but Allen isn't clearly the best eligible first baseman not in. He had tremendous peak value as a hitter but a short career.</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>It's possible Helton beats Pujols to Cooperstown. He's the only one of the above players currently on the ballot and polled at 44.9% last year. He should inch above 50% this year and then see more support as the ballot thins out with the removal of Bonds, Clemens, Schilling and Sosa after this vote.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Second base: Lou Whitaker</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>2024</p>\n<p>Whitaker criminally lasted just one year on the BBWAA ballot, receiving 2.9% of the vote in 2001. Modern analytics have helped create a better appreciation for his career value -- 75.1 WAR. He should appear on his second Modern Era ballot in December of 2023, after receiving six votes from that committee in 2019, six short of the 12 needed (out of 16 voters).</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Robinson Cano, Bobby Grich, Willie Randolph, Chase Utley, Jeff Kent</p>\n<p>Borderline Hall of Fame candidates generally fall into two categories: Those like Helton who have a short peak of dominance but not enough longevity, or those like Whitaker who were mostly pretty good for a long time but never dominant. Look at those recent Veterans Committee selections and you can see why Whitaker looks like a no-brainer to get elected next time around. Whitaker trumps all nine players selected since 2018 in career WAR, with only Alan Trammell, his old double-play mate with the Tigers, coming close, and he has that longevity that helps get Morris, Baines and Kaat elected.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Whitaker made the game look easy. He had no single outstanding skill but did everything well. He was overshadowed in his own time by Ryne Sandberg and then Roberto Alomar, but Whitaker actually has the highest career WAR and OPS+ (117 to Alomar's 116 and Sandberg's 114) of the three -- which shows why offensive context is important (Alomar played in a higher run-scoring era, Sandberg at Wrigley Field).</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>I've been surprised by Kent's lack of support through the years -- he's the all-time leader in home runs by a second baseman, won an MVP Award and only Nap Lajoie and Rogers Hornsby drove in more runs -- but despite the impressive power numbers he may be the sixth-best second baseman not currently in, which makes me a little less enthusiastic about his candidacy. Like Whitaker, Grich and Randolph are underrated, and Utley's extremely high peak will make him an interesting candidate in a couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Third base: Adrian Beltre</h2>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>2024</p>\n<p>With over 3,000 hits, 477 home runs, 1,707 RBIs and five Gold Gloves, Beltre will be an easy first-ballot selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Scott Rolen, Buddy Bell, Graig Nettles, Ken Boyer, Evan Longoria</p>\n<p>There were a slew of very good, not-quite Hall of Fame third basemen who had their best years in the 1970s: Bell and Nettles, plus Sal Bando, Darrell Evans and Ron Cey. All have at least 53 career WAR, with Nettles at 67.9 and Bell at 66.3 thanks to outstanding defensive metrics. There has never been any groundswell of support for either. Boyer, the 1964 NL MVP, has appeared on many Veterans Committee ballots, including the most recent one, and fallen short time after time.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>Rolen is now on his sixth ballot after getting 52.9% last year. He will continue to climb to that 75% threshold for election. While he's a strong candidate based on his excellent two-way game, it would help him if he can get in next year before Beltre hits the ballot as sometimes those head-to-head comparisons can halt a player's progress. So it may be 2025 before he gets in, but I believe he does eventually make it.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Shortstop: Alex Rodriguez</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>Umm ...</p>\n<p>Rodriguez is currently polling at less than 50% on the public ballots. Like Bonds and Clemens, it appears we're headed for a 10-year debate over his worthiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Bill Dahlen, Jimmy Rollins, Omar Vizquel</p>\n<p>Dahlen ranks ninth in WAR among shortstops -- one spot of ahead of Jeter, not to suggest he deserves to go in more than Jeter. Nicknamed \"Bad Bill\" because of his tendency to get ejected from games (65 times as a player and manager), he was a solid two-way player, starting his career in 1891. Dahlen was on the latest Early Baseball ballot and received little support and his chance won't come up again for another 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>Vizquel received 49.1% of the vote last year, but his support has cratered overnight in light of domestic violence accusations from his second wife and then a lawsuit filed in August by a former batboy of the Birmingham Barons accusing Vizquel of sexual harassment when Vizquel managed the team in 2019. (The White Sox investigated the accusations at the time and terminated their relationship with Vizquel.) The early returns for 2022, however, have Vizquel dropping all the way to 10%.</p>\n<p>Vizquel was always a difficult candidate anyway -- the winner of 11 Gold Gloves and the star of SportsCenter highlights for his web gems. He lasted forever, playing his last game at 45 and racking up 2,877 hits. His defensive metrics don't quite match his reputation, leaving his career WAR at a sub-Hall standard of 45.6. With his support from the BBWAA apparently in ruins, Vizquel will eventually go to a Veterans Committee -- and he's certainly the type of player they have liked in the past. We'll see how he's viewed down the road.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Outfield: Barry Bonds, Mike Trout (!), Carlos Beltran</h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>When they're likely to get in: </strong>Not in 2022</p>\n<p>Assuming Bonds falls short -- while he's currently at 80% on public ballots, that total is expected to dip well below 75% when all is said and done (he received 61% last year) -- he immediately becomes eligible to be placed on the ballot decided by the Today's Game committee that will meet in December. In fact, that could be an absolutely stacked ballot if the screening committee puts all these players on it (10 can appear): Not just Bonds, Clemens, Schilling and Sosa, but potentially McGwire and Palmeiro, plus other intriguing candidates including Kenny Lofton, Bernie Williams, McGriff and Kevin Brown.</p>\n<p>As for Trout, he is, believe it or not, already 18th on the all-time WAR list among outfielders despite playing just 89 games over the past two seasons. He's a lock whenever he retires and Beltran, who hits the ballot next year, could be a first-ballot selection as well after a well-rounded career that saw him become one of just 38 players with at least 1,500 runs and 1,500 RBIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton, Dwight Evans, Reggie Smith, Andruw Jones, Gary Sheffield, Jim Edmonds, Bobby Abreu, Ichiro Suzuki, Sammy Sosa</p>\n<p>Those 10 outfielders are ranked in order of career WAR, from 69.3 for Ramirez down to 58.6 for Sosa. Only Ichiro, however, is a clear bet to make it when he becomes Hall eligible in 2025. Lofton, Evans, Smith and Edmonds were on and quickly off the ballot, but all four deserve serious consideration. Those four are why I have problems advocating for Jones and Abreu -- two favorites of the sabermetric community, but two borderline candidates even if you're feeling generous.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Jones' case is all about his defense. He won 10 straight Gold Gloves in center field, when he made the visual and statistical case that he was the best since Willie Mays -- and maybe even better than Mays. He played shallow, he had amazing first-step instincts, and he made the famed Braves rotation better. He also hit 434 home runs, including a 51-homer season in 2005 when he finished second in the MVP voting. Those numbers, while impressive, came in an era when a lot of players were putting up even bigger numbers. Jones finished in the top 10 in his league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage or OPS just once -- fifth in slugging in his 51-homer campaign. He collapsed at age 30, so his counting stats are short of typical standards for a Hall of Fame outfielder.</p>\n<p>Abreu was undoubtedly one of the most underrated players of the past 25 years, with surprising speed despite his build. He was durable, hit for average (six .300 seasons), got on base thanks to his exceptional eye at the plate (.395 career OBP), drove in 100 runs eight times, stole 400 bases and was a solid right fielder -- at least early in his career. Again, however, Abreu's peak came during the extreme offensive environment of the late '90s and early 2000s. He made just two All-Star teams and never finished in the top 10 in the MVP voting. He had seven straight 5-WAR seasons from 1998 to 2004, but never a 4-WAR season after that. He's your classic underappreciated candidate, but his case basically rests on that seven-year peak.</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>The two to watch are Jones and Sheffield, both hovering just below 50%. History says once a player gets to 50% he eventually gets in. Sheffield is on his eighth ballot, however, so time is starting to run out on him, at least for the BBWAA portion of this exercise. Ramirez continues to linger in PED purgatory while Abreu is in the low teens, enough to remain on the ballot, but he needs to start showing progress.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Starting pitcher: Roger Clemens</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>Umm ...</p>\n<p>Keep this in mind: the veterans committee has already rejected McGwire on more than one occasion. Granted, Bonds and Clemens were vastly superior players, arguably the best position player and pitcher ever, but the Hall of Fame players who usually make up half of the 16 electors seem to be a resounding \"no\" on PED users.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Justin Verlander, Curt Schilling, Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Kevin Brown, CC Sabathia, Andy Pettitte, David Cone</p>\n<p><inline5></p>\n<p>Four pitchers:</p>\n<p>Pitcher A: 213-155, 3.33 ERA, 125 ERA+, 3473 IP, 66.4 WAR</p>\n<p>Pitcher B: 203-105, 3.38 ERA, 131 ERA+, 2749 IP, 65.4 WAR</p>\n<p>Pitcher C: 211-144, 3.28 ERA, 127 ERA+, 3256 IP, 68.2 WAR</p>\n<p>Pitcher D: 219-132, 3.41 ERA, 123 ERA+, 3110 IP, 68.0 WAR</p>\n<p>Pitcher A is John Smoltz (elected on first ballot). Pitcher B is Roy Halladay (elected on first ballot). Pitcher C is Brown (lasted one ballot). Pitcher D is Greinke (could be elected on first ballot).</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>Schilling reached 71% last year and frankly should have been elected five years ago, before he lit his own case on fire. He asked to be removed from this year's ballot, was denied, and now looks like he's going to see his percentage decrease. Schilling is clearly above the line for a Hall of Fame pitcher, especially when considering his postseason record (11-2, 2.23 ERA over 133 innings). I do think the Today's Game committee puts him in -- perhaps in December.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Relief pitcher: Billy Wagner</h2>\n<p><strong>When he's likely to get in: </strong>2025</p>\n<p>He's now on his seventh ballot and trending slightly upward, but still sitting at around 50%. Maybe he gets that final-ballot push in 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Next in line: </strong>Joe Nathan, Craig Kimbrel, Kenley Jansen</p>\n<p>Nathan is on his first ballot and while his career is pretty similar to Wagner's, it looks like he won't get the 5% needed to remain on the ballot. Kimbrel's Hall of Fame chances appeared shot until rebounding in 2021. He's now ninth on the all-time saves list, with several of the most dominant relief seasons of the modern closer era, but the knock against Wagner is that he has just 903 career innings and Kimbrel is way behind him at 628. Heck, Schilling threw over 500 innings in just the 2001-02 seasons alone.</p>\n<p><strong>What it means for the 2022 ballot: </strong>If Wagner can get to 50%, I like his chances, especially with the overall quality of the ballot declining with the removal of Bonds, Clemens, Schilling and Sosa (and possibly Ortiz, if he gets in). The fewer candidates the better for a borderline player like Wagner. Remember, voters generally <em>want</em> to elect players: While the BBWAA may throw that shutout, the average ballot so far contains 7.8 votes -- the voters just can't agree on which players.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

FanGraphs estimates that the Angels have created exactly the amount of runs (what they call Batting Runs) as that of an average offense through 81 games. That doesn't sound so bad, and in fact it's in line with the expectation of a team projected to play .500 baseball, until you realize Trout created 34 runs above average, the most in the majors.</p>\n<p>Not only are they collectively average on offense, the Angels are even average on defense, with an adjusted defensive efficiency rating exactly equal to the league average. That represents a drop-off from their recent history of top-10 defensive rankings but it wasn't entirely unexpected given the new faces in the field. One of them, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28662/yunel-escobar\">Yunel Escobar</a>, converted from shortstop to third base, has been a pleasant surprise at the plate.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p><strong>What's gone wrong: </strong>Being average in scoring runs and fielding batted balls isn't a bad start in getting to .500, but in 2016 the Angels haven't sampled anything close to that level of success thanks to their pitching, namely the rotation. With a first-half ERA of 4.83, the Angels ranked 24th in the majors, but perhaps more importantly in terms of where they are going, 26th in <a href=\"http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/siera/\" target=\"_blank\">SIERA</a>. There were no bright spots, given <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30892/garrett-richards\" target=\"_blank\">Garrett Richards</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32672/andrew-heaney\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Heaney</a>'s trips to the 60-day disabled list, and the Angels have attempted to address the problem with the free-agent signing of a former multiple Cy Young Award winner. However, to the sad surprise of no one in the Bay Area, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28705/tim-lincecum\">Tim Lincecum</a> hasn't looked sharp in his first handful of starts.</p>\n<p>Some of the teams with weak rotations, such as the Royals and Orioles, minimize that deficiency with stellar bullpens asked to shoulder a larger-than-average amount of the innings workload. That's not the case with the Angels, who replace high-4 ERA starters with low-4 ERA relievers. Taken as a whole, the staff is arguably the worst in the American League, and are only spared that same ranking across the majors by the historically bad bullpen employed by the Reds.</p>\n<p><strong>Second-half outlook: </strong>Trout must give the Angels the Tiffany bump in terms of pricing for the retail shopper when it comes to placing daily bets. It's inconceivable to me that the Angels are priced as a .500 team, as they were consistently for their first 81 games. I may have viewed the Rangers as incredibly fortunate to lead the AL West at the halfway point and to also have won the most games in the majors, but there is no reason at all Texas should have been priced as a team nearly three games lower than Los Angeles during that time.</p>\n<p>Don't be fooled by the Angels' run differential of minus-31 at the halfway mark, which would suggest the team played more like a 74-win team than a 66-win team. In their 81st game, the Angels beat the Red Sox by 19 runs. The minus-50 run differential through 80 games was more indicative of Los Angeles' true talent level.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
