Cowboys veteran <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a></strong> rises all the way to No. 3, passing <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a></strong>, while Texans rookie <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a></strong> moves up a bit as well. Recent statistics matter over loyalty. The ESPN standard league trade deadline is Wednesday at noon ET, and if you can still acquire one of the top quarterbacks, we recommend it.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the rankings, Jaguars starter <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a></strong> comes off his top two outings of the season, aided by rushing touchdowns, and he returns to the top 10, edging past the Bears' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a></strong> and 49ers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy\">Brock Purdy</a></strong>. The Rams' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a></strong> delivered his first 20-point fantasy outing of the season, but the Browns and Ravens are up next, and another game looms with the 49ers. Vikings starter <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044720/joshua-dobbs\">Joshua Dobbs</a></strong> had a rough Monday, and he may not start the next game. Things change quickly at quarterback!</p>\n<p>Consider the pending schedule and bye weeks -- six teams are off this week, and two others the week after -- before trading. You may still desire trading for Cardinals runner <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a></strong>, for example, but he will not help at all as he sits in Week 14, and then he faces the tough 49ers.</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><b>Trade for:</b> While the surprising Stroud has thrown for more than 300 yards in four consecutive games, with 10 touchdown passes in that span, he cannot match Prescott for fantasy production. Actually, even Allen and Hurts can't. Prescott has scored 28 PPR points in four of five games, accounting for 18 touchdowns, and schedule seems no barrier. Outside the top 10 quarterbacks, consider the lower cost to acquire the Broncos' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a></strong>, Packers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036378/jordan-love\">Jordan Love</a></strong> and perhaps the Buccaneers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a></strong>, for they have appealing schedules.</p>\n<p><b>Be cautious:</b> Baltimore's Jackson continues his slide. Jackson has scored 15 PPR points in only one of the past five games, and he will not help in Week 13, as one of the quarterbacks on bye. Jackson may not be notably better statistically than your current QB, so don't make a trade just for the sake of doing so. The Chargers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a></strong> has been a bit all-or-nothing recently. Stroud still has games with the Jets, Browns and rejuvenated Broncos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><inline1-wide></p>\n<h2>Running back</h2>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p><b>Rankings changes:</b> Several of the top running backs probably deserve to drop in the rankings, but it is tough to find worthy replacements. The Chargers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3068267/austin-ekeler\">Austin Ekeler</a></strong> has been held to single-digit PPR points in his past two games, and the Giants' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley</a></strong> in two of three. Should Lions rookie <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429795/jahmyr-gibbs\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a></strong> or Falcons rookie <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430807/bijan-robinson\">Bijan Robinson</a></strong> pass them? Perhaps not yet. Barkley, Ekeler and the Saints' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054850/alvin-kamara\">Alvin Kamara</a></strong> fall in the overall rankings behind more consistent wide receivers, but they retain their running back standing. The Chiefs' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361529/isiah-pacheco\">Isiah Pacheco</a></strong> and Titans' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043078/derrick-henry\">Derrick Henry</a></strong> move up, and the Rams' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430737/kyren-williams\">Kyren Williams</a></strong> may be top 10 if not for games with the Browns and Ravens the next two weeks. The schedule matters.</p>\n<p><b>Trade for:</b> Trade whatever it takes for the incredible 49er <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a></strong>, who is so alone in the top tier at the position that it is quite silly, but after that, there are so many questions at running back. Perhaps Barkley and Ekeler will be fine. Robinson and the Colts' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242335/jonathan-taylor\">Jonathan Taylor</a></strong> are trending in the right direction. The Dolphins' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576414/raheem-mostert\">Raheem Mostert</a></strong> seems safe for volume. The Titans' Henry is a well-known December fantasy hero.</p>\n<p><b>Be cautious:</b> The Jaguars' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239996/travis-etienne-jr\">Travis Etienne Jr</a></strong>. has been quiet for three consecutive weeks, perhaps due to workload concerns, though high volume remains. The Bengals' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116385/joe-mixon\">Joe Mixon</a></strong> lacked volume and production in his first game sans QB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>. Injured Seahawk <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567048/kenneth-walker\">Kenneth Walker III</a></strong> (oblique) may return soon, but games with the Cowboys, 49ers and Eagles loom. It is not a good time to invest in Seahawks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><inline2-wide></p>\n<h2>Wide receiver</h2>\n<p><b>Rankings changes:</b> Little changes at the top, though the Bengals' <strong>Ja'Marr Chase</strong> returns to the overall top 10, and the Buccaneers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans\">Mike Evans</a></strong> joins him. The Texans' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258173/nico-collins\">Nico Collins</a></strong>, Jets' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a></strong> and 49ers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126486/deebo-samuel\">Deebo Samuel</a></strong> resume their place in the position's top 20, while the Jaguars' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\">Calvin Ridley</a></strong> closes in. Quiet Rams starter <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977187/cooper-kupp\">Cooper Kupp</a></strong> and Panthers veteran <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16460/adam-thielen\">Adam Thielen</a></strong> continue to plummet.</p>\n<p><b>Trade for:</b> There's a reason why wide receivers easily outnumber running backs in the overall top 10. Wide receivers are more consistent and durable. There are 25 flex-eligible players with 160 PPR points this season, and six are running backs. The Texans' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4366031/tank-dell\">Tank Dell</a></strong>, 49ers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360438/brandon-aiyuk\">Brandon Aiyuk</a></strong> and Eagles' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241478/devonta-smith\">DeVonta Smith</a></strong> all share targets with high-profile players, but it hasn't seemed to matter. These receivers are safe, too.</p>\n<p><b>Be cautious:</b> Quarterback play may continue to be a concern for the Bengals' Chase, the Raiders' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a></strong>, Browns' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976499/amari-cooper\">Amari Cooper</a></strong> and Titans' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins\">DeAndre Hopkins</a></strong>. The Vikings' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a></strong> (hamstring) may return in Week 14, after the bye, but there is some risk there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><inline3-wide></p>\n<h2>Tight end</h2>\n<p><inline7></p>\n<p><b>Rankings changes:</b> There is considerable ranking action after the top 10, with the Steelers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361411/pat-freiermuth\">Pat Freiermuth</a></strong>, Rams' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573401/tyler-higbee\">Tyler Higbee</a></strong> and Chargers' <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918639/gerald-everett\">Gerald Everett</a></strong> among the top tight end scorers for the week, and Eagles star <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\">Dallas Goedert</a></strong> (forearm) perhaps returning this week. Packers rookie <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4572680/tucker-kraft\">Tucker Kraft</a> </strong>replaces injured Packers rookie <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428085/luke-musgrave\">Luke Musgrave</a></strong> as a reasonable deep-league option. Falcons <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360248/kyle-pitts\">Kyle Pitts</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054212/jonnu-smith\">Jonnu Smith</a></strong> are again, curiously, barely factors in the Atlanta offense.

  "<p>LAS VEGAS -- To <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, the important offensive number for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> in Sunday's game wasn't necessarily their point total of 31, which matched their second highest output of the season.</p>\n<p>Mahomes was more happy about the numbers zero (as in Chiefs turnovers) and one (as in their dropped passes). The Chiefs have failed most of the year to match their offensive might from previous seasons, but Mahomes said he had the sense all along that if the Chiefs cleaned up their game as they did on Sunday, good things would automatically follow.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"We've shown that we can move the ball, but [turnovers] and drops and me not getting to the right guy at the right time [have limited the Chiefs offensively],'' Mahomes said after a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547557\" target=\"_blank\">31-17 win</a> over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> moved his team to 8-3.</p>\n<p>\"Little things like that, they've kind of stalled some of our drives. We kind of got back to the fundamentals this week and we kept pressing and pushing. We obviously took a step in the positive direction now. Let's just continue to do that throughout the rest of the season.''</p>\n<p>Mahomes won his 15th career game after the Chiefs have trailed by 10 or more points. His winning percentage of 58 in such games is the best in NFL history.</p>\n<p>But the Chiefs hadn't won after a double-digit deficit this season. They've tended to lose after falling behind by any significant margin, so the Chiefs seemed to already be in trouble when they went down 14-0 early in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>That was before Mahomes led the Chiefs on a 71-yard touchdown drive that may have been one of their most important of the season. The Chiefs up until that point had run seven plays and gained 13 yards.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>\"It was big for us to get that first touchdown drive and it kind of got the momentum back in our favor,'' Mahomes said. \"We needed to get that drive, especially after having seven plays in the first quarter.''</p>\n<p>The Chiefs went on to score touchdowns on three of the next four possessions to take control of the game. Two of those touchdowns came in the second half, the Chiefs' first points of any kind in the final two quarters in their last four games.</p>\n<p>Rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a> had eight catches for 107 yards. He is the first Chiefs wide receiver to go over 100 yards in a regular season game since Week 7 of last year. That streak of 20 games was the longest active one in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Rice's biggest play was a 39-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter that helped break open what at the time was a close game. Rice made the reception at the 35 and the rest of the play was him running after the catch and breaking an attempted tackle near the end zone.</p>\n<p>It was the breakthrough game the Chiefs had been waiting for from any of their wide receivers, and it came from the second-round draft pick.</p>\n<p>\"I think we've only scratched the surface, honestly,'' Mahomes said of Rice. \"I think you see us hitting him kind of around the line of scrimmage, [but] I think he can do some of the vertical threat stuff and he has speed and he has bursts.</p>\n<p>\"He has a chance to be a great receiver in this league and we're going to continue to push him to be that receiver every single week.''</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>There's a fun race developing for some of the most valuable real estate in sports. Since the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> moved to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28975474/nfl-playoff-expansion-14-teams-everything-need-know\">14-team playoff field</a> and limited the first-round bye to the top seed in each conference during the 2020 season, landing that bye has been incredibly valuable for teams with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/super-bowl/\">Super Bowl</a> aspirations. In a small sample of six teams, four 1-seeds have advanced to the championship game. That group includes both top seeds a year ago, with the Chiefs and Eagles both enjoying a week off before storming into Arizona for a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401438030\">classic Super Bowl</a>.</p>\n<p>While those same Eagles hold a two-game lead for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/view/playoff\">top spot in the NFC</a>, the No. 1 spot in the AFC <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings\">remains up for grabs</a>. Three different teams held the 1-seed in the AFC at one point or another Sunday. The Jaguars claimed it after the early games with their narrow <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547555\">win over the Texans</a>. A comeback victory by the Chiefs <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547557\">over the Raiders</a> put <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> & Co. in front after the afternoon games. When the Ravens claimed the night game with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547564\">victory over the Chargers</a>, John Harbaugh's team ensured it will hit its upcoming bye atop the conference.</p>\n<p>Throw in the Dolphins, who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547242\">blew out the Jets</a> in the NFL's Black Friday debut, and there are four three-loss teams in the conference. With all due respect to the Browns, Steelers and everyone else in the conference, it's extremely likely the top seed in the AFC will come from one of those three-loss teams riding high atop their respective divisions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Subscribe: <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=15230808\">'The Bill Barnwell Show'</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><a name=\"kc\"></a></p>\n<p>Let's break down that race with six weeks to go.

During Andy Reid's time in Kansas City, Kansas City has gone 18-3 against its division rivals, including a 6-1 record in games against the Raiders after a defeat. Sunday's win was basically a typical matchup between these two teams, as the Chiefs have won the average contest between these two games by a score of 33-19. It wasn't a breeze -- Las Vegas went up 14-0 early in the second quarter -- but the Chiefs scored touchdowns on four of their next five possessions to take control.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p>I talked earlier this season <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/38720747/ranking-nfl-best-defenses-2023-which-team-best-case-chiefs-ravens-browns-49ers\" target=\"_new\">about the Chiefs' defense</a> and how it has thrived. While the Eagles gave Kansas City trouble last week in what ended up as a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547345\">narrow Philly victory</a>, the defense continues to be the cornerstone. The Chiefs rank fifth in the NFL in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed, ensconced between the 49ers in fourth and the Jets in sixth. They rank fourth in points allowed per drive. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047365/josh-jacobs\">Josh Jacobs</a> might have gotten them for a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38986518/josh-jacobs-63-yard-touchdown-run-las-vegas-raiders-lead\">long touchdown run</a> Sunday, but the Chiefs are very, very good on defense.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>My one concern with the Chiefs on paper might have been their pass rush, but they rank third in sack rate. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones\">Chris Jones</a> naturally leads the way and was the best player on the field in that Eagles game, but he's getting more help. Second-year edge rusher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426659/george-karlaftis\">George Karlaftis</a> actually leads the team with eight sacks and 26 initial pressures, although Jones <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38393214/chris-jones-super-pleased-new-chiefs-deal-holdout\">missed the first game</a> of the season. Budding star cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426405/trent-mcduffie\">Trent McDuffie</a> has rushed the passer only 44 times, but he has been a difference-maker with those blitzes, producing two sacks and eight pressures. He has forced five fumbles, although four of those have been after catches.</p>\n<p>Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has been more aggressive in allowing corner <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040432/ljarius-sneed\">L'Jarius Sneed</a> to shadow top receivers. The results have been impressive. Sneed was the primary defender holding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047646/aj-brown\">A.J. Brown</a> to one catch for 8 yards in the Eagles game, and while <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a> gave Sneed trouble early Sunday, the wideout finished with five catches for 73 yards. No No. 1 receiver has managed 50 yards and a touchdown against Kansas City since <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4374302/amon-ra-st-brown\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> got there <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547353\">in the opener</a>.</p>\n<p>Strangely, the Chiefs have found their offense to be lacking in key moments. Drops from wide receivers have been the most pressing problem; a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> drop led to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38379857/chiefs-andy-reid-takes-blame-kadarius-toney-drops-vs-lions\">game-changing pick-six</a> in the Week 1 loss to the Lions, while <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a> dropped a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38965886/chiefs-wide-receivers-lead-nfl-26-drops-season\">would-be touchdown pass</a> late in the defeat against Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>What looked like a weakness for the Chiefs heading into the season has been even worse in reality. Toney has been unable to stay healthy or make consistent plays. For all the hype about how he looked during the offseason, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a> hasn't been able to draw targets and hasn't topped 40 receiving yards in a game since September. Rookie second-round pick <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a> has flashed and just had his first 100-yard game Sunday, but the Chiefs weren't anticipating that Rice and former Bucs backup <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3118892/justin-watson\">Justin Watson</a> would be leading the wideouts in routes on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Can the Chiefs win a Super Bowl with this sort of receiving corps? Yes. We saw them do it last season. That team had <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> instead of Rice, but given how the wideout-needy Patriots have marginalized Smith-Schuster this season, I doubt losing him in free agency has sunk Kansas City at the position.</p>\n<p>The 2022 Chiefs had tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> put up a dominant season, producing 1,338 yards and 12 touchdowns. While he has been <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38584973/chiefs-travis-kelce-says-taylor-swift-relationship-impact-focus\">all over the headlines</a> this season, it hasn't necessarily been because of his play. As Kelce has struggled for consistency -- and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38348042/source-chiefs-travis-kelce-vs-lions-due-injured-knee\">missed the Week 1 loss</a> to the Lions with a knee injury -- has he taken a step backward? It didn't appear he had been as impactful as the player who took over games last season.</p>\n<p>A closer look at the data suggests Kelce hasn't dropped off. In 2022, the future Hall of Famer averaged 2.44 yards per route run, which ranked 11th in the league among all receivers. In 2023? After a solid Week 12, he's actually up to 2.52 yards per route run, which is ... 14th among all receivers. He was targeted on 28.5% of his routes last season and is actually seeing the ball more often this season, with a target rate just north of 30%. On a snap-by-snap basis, he is better than the guy we saw a year ago.</p>\n<p>The difference? He's not playing as many snaps. Reid has steadily brought down Kelce's snap share. After playing a career-high 95% of the snaps during Mahomes' first season as a starter in 2018, his share of the workload has dropped in each of the ensuing seasons. He was at 93% in 2019, 86% in 2020, 82% in 2021, and 80% in 2022. (Those numbers don't include the games he missed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32939954/source-kansas-city-chiefs-te-travis-kelce-covid-19-protocol-vs-pittsburgh-steelers\">because of COVID</a> or sat out while resting.)</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p>This season, leaving aside the Week 1 game, Kelce had played only about 71% of the offensive snaps for the Chiefs before the Eagles game. Unsurprisingly, in a close contest against a great opponent, Reid upped his snap share for that game to 94%, with Kelce playing nearly 20 more snaps than he had in any other game. On Sunday, he was back down to 76% of the offensive snaps. He's now at 74% for the entire season and running about 29 routes per game, down from just over 32 routes per contest a year ago.</p>\n<p>The Philadelphia game should tell us what we need to know. Reid is going to up Kelce's snap rate when the games matter most, which should be no surprise. The good news for Chiefs fans -- and their best case for finishing yet again as the top seed in the AFC -- is there might not be many games taxing Kelce until the postseason.</p>\n<p><b>What's next:</b> The Chiefs have the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">easiest schedule remaining</a> of these four contenders for the top spot in the AFC. A December and January run-in that might have looked tricky on paper over the summer looks much easier in reality, as they don't have a single remaining contest against a team with a winning record.</p>\n<p><a name=\"bal\"></a></p>\n<p>The Bills have dropped to .500, while the Chargers are three games below. The rematch of what has become one of the league's best rivalries will be muted with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886812/jake-browning\">Jake Browning</a> filling in for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> in Cincinnati, while the Chiefs also host the aforementioned Raiders and travel to play a flailing Patriots team. It's hardly out of the question that Kansas City runs the table and finishes 14-3.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> (9-3)</h2>\n<p><b>Week 12 result:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38989725/ravens-beat-chargers-zay-flowers-statement-4th-quarter\">Beat Chargers 20-10</a><br>\n<b>Chances of being the 1-seed, per FPI:</b> 22.5%</p>\n<p>Winning is rarely a pretty endeavor for the Ravens, but pretty isn't necessary when they're hitting the bye after Thanksgiving with the top seed in the AFC. Sunday was a slog on offense, as the Chargers held Baltimore to 13 points for most of the night before a late <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429615/zay-flowers\">Zay Flowers</a> touchdown broke things open. The Ravens won't care about their streak of five consecutive games with 30 points or more ending in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>In a season in which even the 10-1 Eagles have looked vulnerable for long stretches of games, I don't think any team has been more cumulatively dominant on both sides of the football than Baltimore. It has led inside the final two minutes in each of its three losses, games in which it felt like it beat itself as opposed to getting outplayed by the opposing team. Drops cost them an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547427\">overtime loss to the Colts</a>, while sloppy play and five turnovers led to losses to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547460\">Steelers</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547531\">Browns</a>.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>At their best, has any team been more dominant? Early-season wins by multiple scores over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547396\">Texans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547445\">Browns</a> look more impressive with hindsight, given how these teams have played over the remainder of the year. The Ravens have four wins by at least two touchdowns over teams with winning records (the Texans, Browns, Lions and Seahawks). The 49ers are the only other team with more than two, and no team had four such wins in 2022. The last team to have five of those wins in a single season was the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2014\">2014 Patriots</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749027\">won the Super Bowl</a>. Before them, it was the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2007\">2007 Patriots</a>, who went 16-0. We don't often see teams dominate other good squads the way the Ravens have at times this season.</p>\n<p>And yet, based in part on several years of frustrating performances, most Ravens fans likely would be less inclined to sum up this team by pointing to the dominant wins over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547513\">Seahawks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547489\">Lions</a> and lean more toward games like Sunday's. Baltimore had an early 88-yard drive for a touchdown, a few drives in which it ended up in no man's land and had to endure a missed field goal attempt by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15683/justin-tucker\">Justin Tucker</a> before another defensive stop handed the Ravens a short field. Flowers' 37-yard jet sweep to the house put the game to bed, but for most of the contest, the Ravens weren't able to produce the big play or long, steady drives they needed to build a big lead on the Chargers.</p>\n<p>The two key plays on the final meaningful drives for each team might illustrate why the Ravens and Chargers are where they are through Week 12. Flowers' touchdown came on a play in which he was being covered in motion by Chargers cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4037216/essang-bassey\">Essang Bassey</a>. Bassey, 25, began the season with the Broncos before being cut; he had played just 25 defensive snaps with L.A. and was inactive a week ago before being thrust into the lineup. Coach Brandon Staley had already <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38564002/source-patriots-reacquire-cb-jc-jackson-chargers\">traded away</a> 2022 free agent addition <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121649/jc-jackson\">J.C. Jackson</a> and decided to bench cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3053795/michael-davis\">Michael Davis</a>, creating a need for corners in the lineup. Bassey played 40 snaps, but he wasn't able to hang in space with Flowers, who ran past the backup for the game-sealing score.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the field, the Ravens were getting one of the biggest plays of the game from a backup cornerback. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916144/arthur-maulet\">Arthur Maulet</a>, 30, is a  journeyman who has played for five different teams over his seven-year career. He has survived in the league by being versatile and playing special teams. Signed to a one-year deal for just over $1 million by the Ravens in late July, his role on the team was only secured by injuries to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126356/marlon-humphrey\">Marlon Humphrey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035458/trayvon-mullen\">Trayvon Mullen</a>.</p>\n<p>Maulet played just seven defensive snaps Sunday, but it's hard to make more of an impact than he did on those plays. His first defensive snap was an interception on the Hail Mary at the end of the first half. When he came back in during the fourth quarter, he tackled <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3932430/jalen-guyton\">Jalen Guyton</a> in bounds and in open space to keep the clock running. On the fourth-and-6 that ended the drive, he came off the edge on a slot blitz, raised his hands to prevent <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> from firing off a quick pass and then successfully took down a quarterback who outweighs him by nearly 50 pounds for what amounted to a sack. Herbert threw into the air toward nobody in particular as he went down to trigger an intentional grounding. One team's backup cornerback was lacking with the game on the line. The other rose to the occasion.</p>\n<p>The free rusher was a product of a well-timed exotic pressure from Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald, who should be finishing his final season in Baltimore before getting a head-coaching job somewhere. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminSolak/status/1716524752188178538\">The Ringer's Benjamin Solak</a> noted on X, the Ravens are getting incredible performances out of players up and down their defense.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>It's one thing to have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915189/roquan-smith\">Roquan Smith</a> playing at a high level, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16772/kyle-van-noy\">Kyle Van Noy</a> was out of football to begin the season and has six sacks and 21 pressures in nine games. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney\">Jadeveon Clowney</a> was on the market until August before signing a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38215688/former-no-1-pick-jadeveon-clowney-sign-ravens-source-says\">one-year, $2.5 million deal</a>; he has 7.5 sacks and 34 pressures, with the latter mark ranking sixth in the league. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035824/brandon-stephens\">Brandon Stephens</a> was converting to safety during training camp; injuries have forced him to stick at cornerback, and he's been good enough to keep <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3910229/rock-ya-sin\">Rock Ya-Sin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969920/ronald-darby\">Ronald Darby</a> out of the lineup when everyone's healthy.</p>\n<p>Two homegrown players have also made the leap. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/38149478/predicting-nfl-breakout-players-2023-season-bill-barnwell-next-stars\">Before the season</a>, I highlighted <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361422/odafe-oweh\">Odafe Oweh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426507/david-ojabo\">David Ojabo</a> as players who needed to grow for the Ravens to thrive. Oweh has been fine -- he has four sacks -- while Ojabo <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38522181/ravens-wrs-odell-beckham-jr-rashod-bateman-vs-browns\">hit injured reserve</a> after three games. It hasn't been the players I expected or counted on for Baltimore, but it also hasn't mattered with Van Noy and Clowney playing well on the edge.</p>\n<p>Instead, it has been two other players who have made huge strides. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4575517/kyle-hamilton\">Kyle Hamilton</a> was the player the Ravens took as a fallback after the Eagles moved ahead of them for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4381558/jordan-davis\">Jordan Davis</a> in last year's draft. He struggled as a rookie at times, and there were moments it felt like he  might end up as a tweener, lacking the speed to play free safety and the size to play inside the box.</p>\n<p>Well, that's out the window. Hamilton has been a star. He's stellar at rushing the passer and playing at the line of scrimmage, where he has three sacks and 13 pressures on 31 pass rush opportunities. A Hamilton blitz produced a pick-six early in the loss to the Browns. On top of that, he has allowed a <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HamiKy00.htm\" target=\"_new\">45.8 passer rating in coverage</a>, with two picks and eight passes defensed across 40 targets. That's the fifth-best rating in football.</p>\n<p>The even bigger leap has come from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035245/justin-madubuike\">Justin Madubuike</a>, who is having one of the greatest contract years in recent memory. While Madubuike had settled in as a solid interior defender and seemed likely to have a long pro career, I don't think many people saw him as the sort of player who would attract Pro Bowl attention as an interior disruptor.</p>\n<p>He's going there at the end of the season. The fourth-year defender leads the team with 10 sacks and 10 tackles for loss. There's a handful of snaps in each and every game in which Madubuike looks utterly unblockable in the way that guys like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones\">Chris Jones</a> can't be handled by offensive linemen. On Sunday, per NFL Next Gen Stats, his seven pressures tied a career-high. By their pressure metric, Madubuike's 45 pressures are the second most for any defensive tackle this season.</p>\n<p>The Ravens have been able to overcome injuries to Humphrey, Ojabo and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122882/marcus-williams\">Marcus Williams</a> on defense. On offense, the picture is murkier. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241985/jk-dobbins\">J.K. Dobbins</a> has missed most of the season with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38370396/ravens-safety-marcus-williams-shoulder-injury\">torn Achilles</a>. Oft-injured tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980153/ronnie-stanley\">Ronnie Stanley</a> has been in and out of the lineup. Tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews\">Mark Andrews</a> is expected to miss the rest of the regular season after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38916670/ravens-te-mark-andrews-season-likely-due-ankle-injury\">suffering an ankle injury</a> in last week's win over the Bengals.</p>\n<p>The young guys are going to need to win out for the Ravens. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360939/rashod-bateman\">Rashod Bateman</a> struggling to impress and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr\">Odell Beckham Jr.</a> topping 60 yards just once all season, Flowers has needed to step in and be the team's top wideout. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361050/isaiah-likely\">Isaiah Likely</a> played four snaps in Week 10 and has needed to be this team's primary receiving tight end since; he had four catches for a team-high 40 receiving yards against the Chargers.</p>\n<p>The next one up might be speedy rookie back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4596334/keaton-mitchell\">Keaton Mitchell</a>, who was on injured reserve to begin the season before emerging with a 138-yard game late against the Seahawks. He added two big plays on six touches against the Browns, and after a quiet game against the Bengals, he appeared to take the lead role in the backfield Sunday. The rookie undrafted free agent led all backs with nine carries, 11 touches and 89 yards from scrimmage. His speed is a much-needed burst out of the backfield for Baltimore.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Of course, the most important player on the roster is also healthy. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>'s recent seasons <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38938312/ravens-lamar-jackson-proving-resilient-heading-homestretch\">have ended in injuries</a> in Week 14 of the 2021 season and Week 13 a year ago. Having made it through Week 12, he's now on bye before getting the Rams in two weeks. With him producing his best season as a passer since his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28614953/ravens-qb-lamar-jackson-unanimous-pick-nfl-mvp-historic-season\">MVP campaign in 2019</a>, the star quarterback is even more essential to Baltimore's chances of winning than he was over the past two seasons. It hasn't been pretty, but if you told the Ravens before the season that they would be hitting the bye at 9-3 with a healthy Jackson in the fold for the stretch run, that's a deal they would have taken 100 times out of 100.</p>\n<p><b>What's next:</b> After the bye, the Ravens have the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">toughest slate</a> among the four three-loss teams in the AFC. Their final four games are all against teams that currently hold positions in the postseason, with a road trip against the Jaguars and 49ers before home tilts against the Dolphins and Steelers. The Rams, who have won two straight and are about to get a home game against a Browns team playing third-choice quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051308/pj-walker\">PJ Walker</a>, aren't pushovers either.</p>\n<p><a name=\"mia\"></a></p>\n<p>By the time the Rams show up in Week 14, the Ravens might be out of the top spot in the AFC. The Chiefs, Jaguars and Dolphins all have better records in the conference than Baltimore, which would cost it in the case of a tiebreaker. The Ravens can help alleviate those tiebreakers by beating the Jags and Fins, but those three losses to the Browns, Colts and Steelers in the conference could come back to haunt them in a tiebreaker scenario.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/mia.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> (8-3)</h2>\n<p><b>Week 12 result:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38970256/dolphins-overwhelm-jets-qb-tim-boyle-throws-99-yard-int\">Beat Jets 34-13</a><br>\n<b>Chances of being the 1-seed, per FPI:</b> 18.1%</p>\n<p>How much difference can one defender make? At the beginning of the season, when the Dolphins were <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547443\">blown out by the Bills</a> in Buffalo, we were lamenting the loss of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey\">Jalen Ramsey</a>. With the star cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38082716/dolphins-cb-jalen-ramsey-carted-back-locker-room-practice\">sidelined by a meniscus injury</a>, they were vulnerable across from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978935/xavien-howard\">Xavien Howard</a>. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> attacked <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4291489/kader-kohou\">Kader Kohou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15089/justin-bethel\">Justin Bethel</a> in coverage, avoided Howard and threw for 320 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-20 victory.</p>\n<p>Since Ramsey <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38782009/dolphins-jalen-ramsey-ready-build-hot-start\">came back in Week 8</a>, Miami has been a different defense. Before he was back in the lineup, the Dolphins ranked 23rd in EPA per play and last in QBR allowed. From Week 8 onward? They are first in both EPA per play and QBR allowed. By these numbers, Ramsey might be the league's most valuable defender. Who else can transform a defense from worst to first against the pass overnight?</p>\n<p>Let's be realistic, though. The Dolphins have benefited from a friendly slate of opposing quarterbacks over that stretch. While they did have to play <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> in Germany, their other three opponents have been flailing outside of their time against Miami. Ramsey debuted in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547497\">win over the Patriots</a>. His next win came <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547542\">against a Raiders team</a> starting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4260394/aidan-oconnell\">Aidan O'Connell</a>. Last Friday, Ramsey & Co. shut down <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045169/tim-boyle\">Tim Boyle</a> and the Jets in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547242\">34-13 blowout victory</a>.</p>\n<p>Even with the generous slate, it would be tough to argue that Ramsey hasn't made a difference. He has three picks in four games, including two in the seven-point victory over the Raiders. He  has allowed a <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RamsJa00.htm\" target=\"_new\">passer rating of 4.2 in coverage</a> while giving up a total of 60 yards through four games. The Dolphins as a whole allowed 11 plays of 30 yards or more through their seven games without Ramsey; they've given up only two such plays over the ensuing four appearances.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>Ramsey's presence has made life easier for the players around him. Kohou was struggling playing outside, but with Ramsey around, the Dolphins have been able to move their second-year cornerback back into the interior to play in the slot as planned. Ramsey isn't shadowing No. 1 receivers and has mostly stuck to one side of the field, but they have still been able to rely on their coverage.</p>\n<p>Having great cover cornerbacks might typically encourage defensive coordinators to blitz more, given that they can trust the guys holding up behind those rushers in coverage. The Dolphins have basically stopped blitzing and still managed to get home. Over the past month, they have sent extra rushers just 2.6% of the time, which ranks 31st. Despite that modest blitz rating, they still have pressured the opposing quarterback more than 32% of the time over that stretch, which is the 13th-best mark. Their 9% sack rate over that run is in the top 10, and their 8.8% sack rate all season ranks sixth.</p>\n<p>Here's where the Dolphins will find out whether they can win without another singular player on defense. Late in the blowout win over the Jets on Friday, third-year edge rusher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242975/jaelan-phillips\">Jaelan Phillips</a> appeared to catch his foot in the infamous Jersey turf and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38976832/dolphins-jaelan-phillips-suffers-season-ending-torn-achilles\">suffered a torn Achilles</a>. The same turf that took out <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38382172/aaron-rodgers-achilles-injury-next-jets-zach-wilson-2023-playoff-chances\">Week 1</a> will cost Phillips the rest of his season.</p>\n<p>Phillips hasn't yet broken out as a household name, but he has consistently popped on tape as a player whose physical tools could unlock a Pro Bowl-caliber skill set. He had seven sacks and 25 knockdowns a year ago and was in the middle of a streak of five straight games with at least one sack when he suffered the injury. Miami has been more than 17 points of QBR worse without him on the field this season, which includes the game against the Bills, a contest he missed with an oblique injury.</p>\n<p>Unlike with the Ramsey injury, the Dolphins have alternatives up front across from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116733/bradley-chubb\">Bradley Chubb</a> to replace Phillips. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3133487/andrew-van-ginkel\">Andrew Van Ginkel</a> has been an underrated player on the edge, although he has seen time in recent weeks spelling <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916074/david-long-jr\">David Long</a> at inside linebacker. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977740/emmanuel-ogbah\">Emmanuel Ogbah</a> has been buried on the depth chart and played just 21% of the defensive snaps; the veteran will be called into a larger role in the rotation to help cover for Phillips' absence. Miami could also look to add a free agent, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115336/derek-barnett\">Derek Barnett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16761/jeremiah-attaochu\">Jeremiah Attaochu</a> as possible additions.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, the laser show that was the first six weeks of the season has given way to something more inconsistent. Buoyed by their <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38481606/miami-dolphins-score-70-points-vs-broncos-record-day\">70-point effort against the Broncos</a>, Mike McDaniel's offense averaged a league-best 3.2 points per possession through the first six weeks. Since then, the offense has averaged 1.9 points per trip, which is tied with the Chiefs for 17th.</p>\n<p>Some elements of Miami's performance were never going to be sustainable. It converted 21 of its 26 red zone trips into touchdowns during that six-week start, which was the highest rate in football. Over the ensuing five games, it has made 11 trips to the end zone and converted six into touchdowns, dropping its TD rate from nearly 81% to less than 55% from the first half of their season to the second.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>The number of trips is also a concern. The Dolphins' explosiveness on offense means they don't <i>need</i> to have a ton of trips into the red zone to score, but they were both explosive <i>and</i> punishing on their trips down the field early in the season. Since then, they've mostly had to rely on the big play.</p>\n<p>Owing to injuries to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15821/terron-armstead\">Terron Armstead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128713/isaiah-wynn\">Isaiah Wynn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4570495/robert-jones\">Robert Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917592/robert-hunt\">Robert Hunt</a> at different times up front, the offensive line play has been inconsistent. They are still getting the ball out at the fastest rate in football and keeping <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>'s pressure rate low in the process, but what happens when he does get pressured has changed. Through Week 6, his 87.8 QBR when pressured was the best mark of any quarterback. Since then, his QBR when pressured has dropped by nearly 80 points to 9.0, which ranks 22nd. His off-target rate is north of 31% under pressure, which is also in the bottom six among passers.</p>\n<p>Armstead is back, and getting healthier on the interior would help. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429160/de'von-achane\">De'Von Achane</a>'s return from a knee injury was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38939249/dolphins-hold-rb-devon-achane-early-hit-knee\">quickly cut short</a> after a handful of snaps in Week 11, but getting the explosive rookie back into the rotation on a full-time basis would give McDaniel another speed threat to mix into his dazzling playbook. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576414/raheem-mostert\">Raheem Mostert</a> has stayed healthy, which has been a blessing for a team that lost Achane and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122976/jeff-wilson-jr\">Jeff Wilson</a> to injuries.</p>\n<p>It still feels like the Dolphins could use one more receiver behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372016/jaylen-waddle\">Jaylen Waddle</a>, both of whom have been banged up in recent weeks. They have gotten more aggressive in spotting Hill's snap count; after taking 90% of the snaps against the Chiefs, the star has played 59% and 63% of the snaps in the wins over the Raiders and Jets. They typically rest Hill in blowouts, but the win against the Raiders was close throughout, and they didn't break open the Jets game until the fourth quarter. Hill has a legitimate path toward MVP and will want to become the first receiver ever to hit 2,000 yards in a season, but as he battles hand and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38750787/dolphins-wr-tyreek-hill-says-good-play-vs-patriots\">ankle injuries</a>, it would make sense to give him reduced workloads over the next few weeks.</p>\n<p><b>What's next: </b>The Dolphins' next few games should be easily winnable. They travel to face the Commanders on Sunday before welcoming the Titans and Jets to Miami. Those three teams have gone a combined 2-10 in November. Losing in any of those games would be a catastrophic upset for their chances of landing the top seed.</p>\n<p>After that, things get tougher. The Dolphins host the Cowboys on Christmas Eve, travel to face the Ravens on New Year's Eve and finish up in Week 18 against the Bills. Four of their final six games are at home, where they're 5-0, but those five home wins have come against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547429\">Broncos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547465\">Giants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547473\">Panthers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547497\">Patriots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547542\">Raiders</a>. The Cowboys and the Bills will be much stiffer competition.</p>\n<p><a name=\"jax\"></a></p>\n<p>While Miami was able to launch an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401437633\">incredible comeback victory</a> over the Ravens in Baltimore a year ago, this is a much better Ravens defense than the one we saw at the beginning of 2022. If the Dolphins end up with the top seed in the conference, they'll have earned it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/jax.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>4.<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> (8-3)</h2>\n<p><b>Week 12 result:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401547555\">Beat Texans 24-21</a><br>\n<b>Chances of being the 1-seed, per FPI:</b> 15%</p>\n<p>It's tough to have as much riding on a single play in Week 12 as the AFC South had on a field goal attempt. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3919602/matt-ammendola\">Matt Ammendola</a>'s 58-yard kick at the end of Sunday's game would have tied the score at 24 and sent it into overtime. A Texans win would have tied them with their division rivals from Jacksonville at 7-4 and given <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a> & Co. an unassailable tiebreaker after sweeping the Jags in the regular season. The Jags would have dropped, in real time, to the sixth seed.</p>\n<p>Instead, Ammendola's kick hit the base of the stanchion and bounced out. Jacksonville's victory pushed it two games ahead of Houston in the AFC South. The victory canceled out the Texans' win earlier, leaving the Jags with significant tiebreaker advantages and effectively giving Doug Pederson's team a 2½-game lead over the Texans with six games to go. As they walked off the field, the Jaguars were the top seed in the AFC.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Had the Jaguars allowed even a single additional yard to Stroud and the Texans offense on that final drive, Ammendola's kick would have been good, and the two teams would have headed to overtime. The Texans actually had started their last series of the game 2 yards closer to the end zone, but the Jaguars started that final series with a sack and then pressured Stroud into a third-down incompletion.</p>\n<p>The Jags didn't stop Stroud altogether, but they sacked him twice on that final drive, knocked him down seven times and pressured him on 21 of his 46 dropbacks, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Stroud produced 258 yards on his 25 blissful, pressure-free dropbacks, but the 21 pressured looks netted only 46 yards. The pass rush won the game.</p>\n<p>While the most obvious path for a Jaguars leap in 2023 involved <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a> playing at an MVP level, they find themselves competing for the top spot in the conference because of what has  been going on up front. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915239/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, who had 2.5 sacks and four knockdowns Sunday, has been stellar. Next Gen Stats noted that he had 12 pressures Sunday,<a href=\" https://twitter.com/NextGenStats/status/1728888719401484509\" target=\"_new\"> the most for him in any single game as a pro</a>. Eight of them came against Pro Bowl left tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051890/laremy-tunsil\">Laremy Tunsil</a>. Allen now has a career-high 12 sacks with six more games remaining.</p>\n<p>Allen has been the true standout player and the Defensive Player of the Year candidate on this roster, but he's not the only one. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426349/travon-walker\">Travon Walker</a>, the No. 1 pick in the 2022 draft, hasn't outplayed No. 2 pick <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372099/aidan-hutchinson\">Aidan Hutchinson</a>, but he has flashed more often in his sophomore season. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050073/foyesade-oluokun\">Foyesade Oluokun</a>, the team's big free agent addition at linebacker, is playing at an All-Pro level. Fellow starting linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4243256/devin-lloyd\">Devin Lloyd</a> had a tough time against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3040151/george-kittle\">George Kittle</a>, but a defense that was 32nd in the NFL in QBR on throws to tight ends last season is the third-best at the moment.</p>\n<p>For the first time since that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/jax/season/2017\">fateful 2017 campaign</a> -- when Jacksonville nearly beat New England in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999172\">AFC title game</a> -- the Jaguars have a legitimately impressive defense. They rank 10th in EPA per play on defense this season and fourth in win probability added on that side of the ball, behind only the Steelers, Ravens and Eagles. EPA doesn't adjust for strength of schedule, but <a href=\"https://www.ftnfantasy.com/nfl/tools/team-total-dvoa\">DVOA</a> does, and the improvement there is even bigger: Jacksonville ranked 23th in defensive DVOA a year ago and was sixth before Sunday's game, when it held the Texans to 21 points across 10 drives, albeit with the help of two missed field goals from Ammendola.</p>\n<p>Since allowing 30 points to the Texans' offense in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547435\">blowout loss in Week 3</a>, the Jacksonville defense has allowed 20 points or fewer in six of its eight ensuing games. The Saints <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547483\">got to 24</a>, but the most difficult challenge the Jaguars faced over the past two months was the one time their defense failed: The 49ers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547532\">marched up and down the field</a> and scored 34 points in a rout. The only moral victory might have been denying <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a> a touchdown at the end of the game, snapping the star back's consecutive games streak.</p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<p>The Jags have won seven of their past eight games, but that loss to the 49ers will be an easy disqualifier for observers who don't believe in AFC South teams. There have been seasons in which the top team in the South has beaten up on bad competition, but that hasn't really been the case this year. The teams Jacksonville has played during this 7-1 stretch have a combined record of 47-42. You can argue the Steelers might not be quite as impressive as their record, but the Jaguars have beaten two teams in the playoffs as they currently stand and a handful of others competing for wild-card spots over this stretch.</p>\n<p>If anything, offensive inconsistency remains a problem for the Jaguars, who have had more near-scores go awry for various reasons than any other team. While Lawrence averaged 9.6 yards per attempt Sunday, the narrow victory was another example. At the end of the first half, he hit <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk</a> on a deep crossing route for 57 yards, with Kirk stepping out of bounds a yard before the goal line. With one second left on the clock, Pederson sent two extra offensive linemen onto the field and attempted to pitch the ball to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239996/travis-etienne-jr\">Travis Etienne</a>, only for immediate penetration into the backfield to blow up the play for no gain, costing them what could have been game-changing points.</p>\n<p>If you believe that a killer instinct is a thing for an NFL offense, the Jaguars lack it. They have averaged 4.1 points per red zone trip this season, which ranks 29th. Only the widely panned offenses of the Saints, Jets and Giants have been worse. Jacksonville has eight whiffs for no points across its 31 red zone opportunities; only the Giants have come away from the red zone without any points more often.</p>\n<p>The Jags have to find a way to execute more consistently in the red zone. Some of the issues have been with the offensive line, which has never seemed to get settled after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115313/cam-robinson\">Cam Robinson</a> was suspended for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38593082/jaguars-lt-cam-robinson-return-suspension-vs-bills\">first month of the season</a>. Rookie right tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4692525/anton-harrison\">Anton Harrison</a> struggled early before improving as the season has progressed, and left guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4611506/ben-bartch\">Ben Bartch</a> was benched for swing tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242554/walker-little\">Walker Little</a>, who missed the better part of four games with a knee injury. They <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38788070/jaguars-bolster-o-line-trade-vikings-ezra-cleveland\">traded for</a> Vikings guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4048231/ezra-cleveland\">Ezra Cleveland</a> and needed him Sunday, when Robinson suffered a knee injury in the first half and wasn't able to return. Little moved back to left tackle and will stay there if Robinson is out for any extended period of time. The line has to play better, especially in short yardage, for the offense to thrive.</p>\n<p>Etienne's workload was also becoming a problem. Through Week 8, his 151 carries were 14 more than any other player in the league. That's not the sort of workload Pederson typically wants to give his primary back, and it's not the best use of Etienne, who was averaging only 3.9 yards per carry. With rookie third-round pick <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429013/tank-bigsby\">Tank Bigsby</a> struggling, though, they needed another solution.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139602/dernest-johnson\">D'Ernest Johnson</a>, who has been a difference-maker over the past two games. Against the Titans, Johnson had a 34-yard catch to help set up a field goal before halftime. On Sunday, the former Browns back took a screen 42 yards to help set up a Lawrence touchdown. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3061612/jamal-agnew\">Jamal Agnew</a> on injured reserve, he's also serving as the team's kick returner. Keeping Etienne fresh for January is going to be essential for the Jaguars.</p>\n<p><inline5></p>\n<p>So much of the conversation about the Jaguars revolves around Lawrence, and you can understand why: He's a legendary college player who is the most conspicuous player on a team that often flies under the national radar. Right now, he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr\">ranks ninth in QBR</a>; the passing offense has its problems, but it's neither carrying them to victories nor keeping them from competing. What happens around Lawrence is going to determine whether they stay in this rarified air or fall back in the weeks to come.</p>\n<p><b>What's next:</b> The Jaguars have six more games to go, with two coming against teams currently occupying playoff spots in the Browns and Ravens. They have three matchups against backup quarterbacks down the stretch, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a> both out for the season and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill\">Ryan Tannehill</a> benched for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361418/will-levis\">Will Levis</a> in Tennessee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Andy Reid was in a familiar place after Monday night's loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, trying to explain why the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>' passing game failed again.</p>\n\n\n<p>Reid didn't say anything he hadn't before recent games. He said things between <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> and many of his receivers were off and that the receivers were dropping too many passes. He pledged that the Chiefs would fix the problem.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"All of these things have been kind of self-inflicted,\" Reid said. \"We've got to take care of that.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The time for a fix may have passed. The Chiefs are 10 games into the season and lead the league in dropped passes with 26, six more than any other team, and a drop percentage at 7.1. Mahomes has thrown nine interceptions and is headed for the worst statistical season of his career.</p>\n\n\n<p>The time for the Chiefs to give Mahomes more help passed in the offseason, when they could have signed any of several veteran wide receivers, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr\">Odell Beckham Jr</a>., <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins\">DeAndre Hopkins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a>, among others.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs instead spent much of their available money on defensive players, one for each level: lineman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929865/charles-omenihu\">Charles Omenihu</a>, linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3129310/drue-tranquill\">Drue Tranquill</a> and safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3155647/mike-edwards\">Mike Edwards</a>. They went with who they had at wide receiver, adding only a rookie, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a>, in the second round of the draft.</p>\n\n\n<p>An argument could be made that the Chiefs did the right thing. Omenihu, Tranquill and Edwards are playing well and helping the Chiefs become one of the NFL's top defensive teams. The Chiefs had stocked up the year before at wide receiver, signing veteran <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a>, trading for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> and drafting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a>.</p>\n<inline1>\n<p>A better question: Why haven't those players given the Chiefs more? The Chiefs knew the early part of the season would be a developmental one for many of their receivers, with Valdes-Scantling being the only as an established NFL regular.</p>\n\n\n<p>But that process is taking longer than the Chiefs hoped. The rookie, Rice, leads the wide receivers by significant margins in catches (36), yards (420) and touchdowns (4).</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Our expectation is to score a lot more than we did,\" wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3118892/justin-watson\">Justin Watson</a> said after the 21-17 defeat Monday night to the Eagles. The Chiefs were scoreless in the second half for the third straight game.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We've got to figure out how to get it fixed quick. Some of it is just the way defenses are playing us, some of it we've just got to make plays.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Watson is second among Chiefs wide receivers in catches (19) and yards (329). That it's Rice and Watson leading the way is a shock to the Chiefs, who believed going into the season that their big three would be in some order of Toney, Valdes-Scantling and Moore.</p>\n\n\n<p>Those three players have combined for 53 catches, 493 yards and 3 touchdowns -- less than tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> by himself.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs traded for Toney midway through last season believing he might emerge as a No. 1 type of receiver. They tried to acquire him earlier in his career, hoping he would fall to them in the 2021 draft and then trying to deal for him months before they finally made it happen.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He can do anything,\" general manager Brett Veach said last spring. \"He's predominately been a guy that is a slot receiver, returner, runner, gadget guy if you will, but I don't know if there is a limit on his game because he has a vertical game. It's a fair question to [ask], 'Has he ever played with a quarterback that likes to push the ball down the field [like Mahomes]?'</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We have a lot of high hopes for him. He was a first-round pick for a reason. There's a reason why we traded for him and we felt like he was first-round talent. ... I think the sky is the limit for him.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Toney missed all of training camp after having surgery to repair a torn meniscus but he's played in every game. However, he has had minimal impact, and the Chiefs before the recent trade deadline acquired <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035004/mecole-hardman-jr\">Mecole Hardman Jr</a>., a player with similar skills as Toney.</p>\n\n\n<p>Valdes-Scantling has been the most disappointing of Chiefs receivers. He has never been a high-volume pass-catcher in six NFL seasons, but usually delivered a large number of big plays.</p>\n\n\n<p>He is averaging a healthy 17.8 yards per catch this season but has only 14 receptions. He had one game this season with more than two catches. Against the Eagles, he didn't catch any passes and his drop near the end zone contributed to the defeat.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I know we all look at the numbers ... but here is a lot that he does well that sometimes doesn't show up on the stat sheet,\" offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said, pointing to Kelce's touchdown against the Eagles, where Valdes-Scantling effectively screened Kelce's defender, freeing him to score.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He does a lot of that and I think that's a credit to him and that can be very selfless at times, which we love. Production-wise, he's not where he was last year and we do know that we have hopefully a bunch of season left and we want to be able to continue to keep working through these things as we have these different wide receivers.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes has been affected by the drops. He had an interception returned for a touchdown after it was deflected by Toney in a one-point, season-opening loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a>. Moore dropped a pass in the end zone as the Chiefs were trying to rally in what would become a Week 8 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Valdes-Scantling's drop against the Eagles was as damaging as any. Mahomes immediately put his hands on his head in shock, perhaps knowing the Chiefs' best chance to win had slipped by.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"They know I'm going to keep firing it,\" Mahomes said. \"That's just who I am. I'm going to fire it to the guy who's open and usually they're going to make the play. It happens. ... A lot of stuff happened throughout the game and so you just have to keep firing.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

You're a f---ing baller.\"</p>\n<p>So what should we expect this weekend from the frenemies?</p>\n<p>\"Both of them,\" Raiders cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239694/amik-robertson\" target=\"_new\">Amik Robertson</a> said with his eyes wide, \"got an X factor to them.\"</p>\n<p>And then some.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Even the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\" target=\"_new\">Miami Dolphins</a> prepped for Crosby's extra-curriculars last week.</p>\n<p>As seen on the most recent HBO \"Hard Knocks\" in-season series, the Dolphins referred to Crosby as a \"Tasmanian Devil\" who \"goes and goes and goes and goes.\"</p>\n<p>So they had practice squad linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3933407/quinton-bell\" target=\"_new\">Quinton Bell</a>, a draft classmate of Crosby's with the Raiders in 2019, mimic Crosby's harassment by bumping, pushing, grabbing and just generally needling quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\" target=\"_new\">Tua Tagovailoa</a> in practice.</p>\n<p>\"That's a real look,\" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel told Bell.</p>\n<p>Yeah, Crosby is starting to live rent free in opponents' domes.</p>\n<p>\"I had so many people reaching out, but I love it,\" Crosby said earlier this season of his interaction with Mahomes. \"Honestly, it's cool that the fans kind of get to see the other side of it. Obviously, K.C. fans are like, 'F--- Crosby, he's this and that.' I really don't care. I love it.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to keep going harder, so they're going to have to get used to it. But it is what it is. Honestly, that's who I am. Now they get to see it a little bit more up close. But I think it's incredible. It's cool. I was telling some of the people, I'm like, 'Y'all should mic me up for a whole year. It would be a straight crazy-ass documentary.'\"</p>\n<p>Raiders interim coach Antonio Pierce, who played linebacker in the NFL with Washington and the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\" target=\"_new\">New York Giants</a> from 2001 through 2009, said he had a similar rivalry with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\" target=\"_new\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> quarterback Donavan McNabb.</p>\n<p>Pierce recalled McNabb, in a runaway Eagles win, running out of bounds on the Giants sideline and picking up the telephone near the bench.</p>\n<p>\"And [McNabb] told our coordinators that we needed help down there on the field,\" Pierce recalled with a grin. \"But it's alright, because we got them back the next year, we sacked him [12] times and I called his coordinator and his O-line coach, so it was fun. Good dude, man, very competitive player. It was always fun playing against Andy Reid and McNabb.\"</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Reid was the Eagles' coach then. Now, he's taken the Chiefs to three Super Bowls, winning two, and Pierce will be matching wits with Reid, while Crosby and Mahomes have their own battle within the game.</p>\n<p>But shouldn't a rivalry be less one-sided?</p>\n<p>Consider: Since Crosby's NFL arrival, the Chiefs have won seven of eight matchups with the Raiders, and Mahomes has passed for 2,464 yards with 21 touchdown passes and two interceptions while completing 66.8% of his passes in those meetings.</p>\n<p>Still, three of Crosby's four sacks against Mahomes, and three of his nine QB hits against the Chiefs QB, came last season. Games won by Kansas City by a cumulative 61-42.</p>\n<p>Yet, there's a unique cycle in place, and Las Vegas may actually be due. Since 2014, after every Raiders win in the series, the Chiefs have run off five straight wins against them. The Chiefs are currently riding a five-game winning streak in the series.</p>\n<p>Not that that matters much to the players, right?</p>\n<p>\"In reality, it's awesome getting to see Mahomes,\" said Crosby, who has 10.5 sacks. \"The dude is a dog, there's a reason why he wins. That's the type of guys I want around me. That's why we compete. I know I'm one of the best, he's one of the best and that's what brings that competitive nature out of us.</p>\n<p>\"So, people getting to see that is pretty cool.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

And while it doesn't alter what happed in Super Bowl LVII, it does put Philadelphia in great position as it makes a push for a return trip to the championship game.

  "<p><video1></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</a></strong> tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a>'s route on third-and-3 in the third quarter of a Week 3 matchup against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a> was supposed to take him to the back-right corner of the end zone, but he saw the defense leaving the middle uncovered.</p>\n\n\n<p>So Kelce stopped there instead. That's when quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> spotted him and got Kelce the ball for an easy, 3-yard touchdown.</p>\n\n\n<p>With thousands of throws and countless hours in the video room between them, Mahomes and Kelce made the play work even though it wasn't as the Chiefs designed it.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"You're talking about two guys that have the instincts that not many people have,\" Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said. \"There's a balance, because sometimes when you're watching tape with rookies or guys that come in, [they ask], 'Why did Kelce do that or do this?' Well, he has an innate ability to recognize defenses. It's on another level. What's crazier is the fact that Pat knows it, too.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Sometimes we don't even practice it. They just do it. ... There's some stuff in there, DNA-wise, between those two guys, that a lot of people don't have. They have that connection.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The connection started in 2018 when Mahomes became the Chiefs' starter, and it's one of the NFL's all-time greats between a quarterback and tight end. Kelce has 50 touchdown catches from Mahomes, making them the fourth QB-TE duo to reach that mark. They are also fourth for a quarterback and tight end in catches (550) and yards (6,895).</p>\n<inline1>\n\n\n<p>Most of those catches, yards and touchdowns have come from plays that were run just as coach Andy Reid designed them. But not all.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I'm trying my hardest to just run this thing like Coach Reid dials it up,\" Kelce said. \"You want to get creative, but at the right time. ... Coach Reid does a great job of putting a lot of work into making these plays make sense for the quarterbacks, so you don't want to get off script too much.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"All that creative stuff is fun. But for the most part, I would say about 99% of the time, I'm doing what Coach wants me to do.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Things don't always go so well when the two players improvise. Mahomes nearly threw an interception against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> in Week 4 when Kelce stopped a route in the middle of the field and Mahomes threw it to the spot Kelce was headed.</p>\n\n\n<p>But when it does work, it can deliver big results. In the 2021 AFC divisional round against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a>, Kelce told Mahomes he would alter his route to run up a seam in the pass coverage on the Chiefs' final offensive play of the fourth quarter as they were scrambling to get into field goal range.</p>\n\n\n<p>Kelce's 25-yard catch set up the field goal that sent the game into overtime. The Chiefs went on to the Super Bowl.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He does a great job of whenever he's open, he doesn't get himself covered,\" Mahomes said. \"Coach Reid gives them the freedom [that] if you're open, stay there and don't get yourself covered and run the route like we've run it in practice a thousand times. [Kelce] does a great job of that.</p>\n<p>\"It's something that you can't take for granted. It's almost like he's playing Madden, like he can read the coverage and stop in the windows and be open and be on the same page as me at all times.\"</p>\n<p>Over a stretch of three games this season, Mahomes completed 28 straight passes to Kelce. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, the odds of all 28 passes being completed based on completion probability was 1 in 3,000.</p>\n<p>Statistics like that are why Nagy said he has this advice for young receivers who come to the Chiefs wanting a connection with Mahomes like the one Kelce has: It's going to take a long time, and in the meantime, don't do what Kelce does.</p>\n<photo2>\n<p><strong>YOUNG RECEIVERS AREN'T</strong> the only ones who marvel at how Mahomes and Kelce connect. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> coach Brandon Staley has watched his defense get beat many times by the two players.</p>\n<p>In five games against the Chargers with Staley as their head coach, Kelce has 40 catches, 640 yards and six touchdowns.</p>\n<p>\"He does everything at such a premium level,\" Staley said. \"I think the thing that is tough is just the chemistry that he and Patrick have. No matter what the coverage is -- man, zone, pattern-match zone -- it doesn't matter. He just has an outstanding feel of how to attack and beat leverage. When you have that type of feel in the passing game, he can get open when the play isn't necessarily designed to go that way.</p>\n<inline2>\n<p>\"Then he and Pat just have that eye contact, that chemistry of feeling space and areas and going to it. The other thing that Travis does such a good job of is running with the football after the catch. He's one of the top tight ends to ever play. A lot of respect for him.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes said even backup quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13987/blaine-gabbert\">Blaine Gabbert</a>, in his 12th NFL season but first with the Chiefs, asked him after the touchdown against the Bears why Mahomes goes off script with Kelce so frequently with desired results.</p>\n<p>Gabbert said he has seen other top passing combinations like Tom Brady to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13229/rob-gronkowski\">Rob Gronkowski</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a> work in similar ways, but not to the depth of Mahomes to Kelce.</p>\n<p>In fact, Mahomes and Kelce have connected for more yards (5,598) and touchdowns (40) than any quarterback-receiver duo in the NFL since 2019, according to ESPN Stats & Information. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs\">Stefon Diggs</a> have 36 TDs, as do <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16460/adam-thielen\">Adam Thielen</a>. Cousins and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a> have the second-most yards in that span (5,348).</p>\n<p>\"Travis sees defenses like a quarterback, and he has that feel that we see and he can see it as the play is developing,\" Gabbert said. \"So it's something that a lot of people on our team try and emulate, but you really can't duplicate because of who he is as a player and the relationship that he has with Pat throughout the game. ... They make it almost seem like basketball, and as a quarterback, it's very friendly that he's always working to get open to give us an open throw.</p>\n<p>\"I'm fortunate to be here now to really see it on a firsthand basis, because in [the past] you watch them on film, but you really didn't know what was going on to know the reasons behind it.\"</p>\n<photo1>\n\n\n<p><strong>KELCE JOINED THE</strong> Chiefs in 2013, five years before Mahomes became the starter. A quarterback for a time in college at Cincinnati, Kelce had a similar working relationship with Alex Smith, Mahomes' predecessor at quarterback.</p>\n\n\n<p>It didn't take long for Mahomes and Kelce to develop what they have now.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It just took a couple years of just working with him,\" Mahomes said. \"Not only did I get a feel for how he runs routes, but he got a feel for how I was seeing stuff, so just that combination of stuff I think developed that connection where we can kind of go off the radar screen and kind of develop some stuff that isn't necessarily called.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Kelce was a big booster of Smith and has said he was not thrilled initially when the Chiefs traded him to Washington to clear room for Mahomes.</p>\n\n\n<p>But his career has blossomed since Mahomes took over. The five best statistical seasons of Kelce's career have come with Mahomes at quarterback, and he is on pace for a sixth this season.</p>\n<p>\"Pat has the instinctual ability to do things that I've never seen anybody else do on the football field,\" Kelce said. \"That's where he separates himself and he kind of shows his own personality in that regard. In terms of situational football, understanding of the rules of the game, time management, all those things that coach Reid is the guru of, Pat is as well. [Their connection is a result of] being in the same meetings, understanding how coach Reid does things and in training camps, having countless amount of time to be able to just go over all those things.\"</p>\n<p>The result is plays like the touchdown against the Bears. Kelce saw it, Mahomes saw it, and they trusted it would work out well, as it has for them many other times.</p>\n<p>\"I just kind of understand what he's going to do, some stuff that he's not really supposed to do,\" Mahomes said. \"There are times in practice where we were thinking about making a call for that when we get that look for him to run that route.</p>\n<p>\"I remember I was telling the coaches, 'I don't know why we need a call. He's going to do it anyway.' So of course he does it, and it's a touchdown.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

But after years of winning with a powerful offense and a defense that was often just along for the ride, getting things done a different way has meant the world they've known is upside down.</p>\n<inline1>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes has been quick after several wins this season to credit the defense for doing the heavy lifting. However, coach Andy Reid complained recently about the offense doing things \"that I haven't seen before,\" a reference to dropped passes, incorrect pass routes, turnovers, penalties and a general lack of production.</p>\n\n\n<p>For tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a>, it's been outright frustration.</p>\n<p>\"Our defense is playing their tail off,\" Kelce said recently on his New Heights podcast. \"For us to keep turning it over, we're putting them in bad situations and they're saving our tail, it's getting real one-sided. ... It's not like what we've been in the past. We've got in my mind the best offensive mind in the game. We've got the best quarterback so this is not acceptable and we all feel that way.</p>\n<p>\"It's a challenge at this point in the season to get this thing right right now before it gets out of control and it gets really bad.\"</p>\n<p>This is from a team on pace to become the AFC's top playoff seed.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring last year but entered Week 11 at 13th in points at 23.1 per game, averaging about six fewer than last season. They have been surprised by limited contributions from wide receivers like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a>.

At his current rate, he will finish with a career-high 15 interceptions and have a career-low passer rating of 96.7. He will have 32 touchdown passes, his second-lowest total. He had 26 in 2019, when he played in 14 games.</p>\n<p>He has talked with resolve after some recent games that the Chiefs will again resemble the powerful offensive team they have been in recent years.</p>\n<p>\"All you can do is keep working,\" Mahomes said. \"That's everything. It's me with timing. It's [receivers] just continuing to get catches as much as possible. Lucky for us, our defense is playing so good, so we are sitting here 7-2 ... We can get better as an offense. I think if the offense can get where it needs to be, I think we'll be a hard team to beat.</p>\n<p>\"We understand that it's going to take the offense at some point to have to have the big game to win it [but] our defense is holding it down for us right now.\"</p>\n<photo1>\n<p>Mahomes hasn't been as pointed publicly about the offense's lower production, but acknowledged he's struggling with how the season has developed.</p>\n<p>\"I'm just used to going out there and being able to -- I have that mentality I want to go out there and score every drive,\" he said. \"At the same time, you've got to win the football game, so I can't let maybe a drive or two that we didn't get in the end zone affect the full scope of the entire game.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of trying to press or do something crazy or scramble around or do something, I'm just going to take it one play at a time to move the ball down the field and I know that if our defense is playing that well, if I can just continue to just put points on the board, we're going to win the football game. At the end of the day, that's all that matters.\"</p>\n<p>The Chiefs entered the weekend tied for the league lead in scoring defense at 15.9 points per game. They have multiple defenders playing well on all three levels.</p>\n<p>In the secondary, the Chiefs have four regulars who were drafted last year and all have delivered, particularly cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426405/trent-mcduffie\">Trent McDuffie</a>, who is having a Pro Bowl-worthy season. The Chiefs are so versatile in the secondary that they can move players around to get favorable matchups.</p>\n<p>Veteran cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040432/ljarius-sneed\">L'Jarius Sneed</a> has frequently shadowed the opponent's top wide receiver with great results. Among the top 15 NFL receivers in terms of catches, the Chiefs have faced six. None has more than 71 yards and only one scored a touchdown.</p>\n<p>\"The thing about [Sneed] is that he loves a challenge,\" Spagnuolo said. \"He wants to go against their very best. That's why we do it. When you have a guy like that that you have confidence in that you can put on their best guy, I think the other 10 guys rally around that.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

How will each defense game plan to slow the offensive playmakers? Which team has the better chance to get back to the Super Bowl in February? We even asked whether the Eagles or Chiefs have the better rookie class, for the latest buzz on pending free agents for each franchise and whether a sleeper player could put up big numbers on Monday.

Both quarterbacks are obviously elite, but I just think the Chiefs' defense might limit <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a> a little more than the Eagles' defense will limit Mahomes. That's especially true for the secondary, since Philadelphia is allowing a 66.6% completion percentage to opponents, 21st in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Plus, I know Chiefs coach Andy Reid has probably made good use of the bye week and schemed up ways for Mahomes to have success on Monday night.</p>\n<p><a name=\"gameplan\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How can the Chiefs limit Hurts' scrambling ability?</h2>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p><strong>Matt Bowen, NFL analyst:</strong> Hurts has produced 127 yards on scramble attempts, converting 11 of his 27 rushes into first downs. I'm looking for Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo to attack and contain the edges of the pocket with pressure schemes in critical game moments. Kansas City blitzes 31.8% of the time, ninth most in the NFL, and they have played zero-man on 8.3% of opponent dropbacks. Simply put, the Chiefs can't let Hurts extend plays with his legs Monday night.</p>\n<hr><alsosee>\n<h2>How should the Eagles take away <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> in the game plan?</h2>\n<p><strong>Bowen:</strong> The Eagles have played man coverage on 51.2% of opponent dropbacks this season, and they need a matchup for Kelce. He's seeing 31.9% of the Chiefs' targets and averaging 74.6 yards per game this season.</p>\n<p>I would expect safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574056/kevin-byard\">Kevin Byard</a> to get reps here to start. But corners <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2572841/james-bradberry\">James Bradberry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15863/darius-slay\">Darius Slay</a> could also be in the mix when Philly plays 2-man to get a safety over the top -- especially when Kelce is aligned to the backside of 3x1 sets. And when the Eagles do jump into their zone coverages, they must dedicate a player to rerouting Kelce at the snap.</p>\n<p><a name=\"receiver\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What are the Chiefs saying about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a>'s future as WR1, and do you expect them to be aggressive in the WR market this offseason?</h2>\n<p><strong>Adam Teicher, Chiefs reporter:</strong> Rice is already being used like the Chiefs' WR1. He's playing more lately (104 routes since Week 5, second among Kansas City wideouts behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a>), and he leads the team's wide receivers in catches (32) and yards (378). And when the Chiefs have needed a big play, they've gone his way most often when they're not looking to Kelce.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have invested at receiver since trading <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a> to the Dolphins, including drafting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a> in the second round in 2022 and trading for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035004/mecole-hardman-jr\">Mecole Hardman Jr</a>. at the deadline in back-to-back years. But they've yet to see returns other than with Rice (second-round rookie) and, on occasion, Valdes-Scantling (2022 signing) making plays. Besides Hardman -- who left and returned -- every one of their current WRs arrived after Hill departed.</p>\n<p>So yes, they may decide they need to invest at the position again this offseason. Names like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239993/tee-higgins\">Tee Higgins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans\">Mike Evans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\">Calvin Ridley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035687/michael-pittman-jr\">Michael Pittman Jr</a>. could be <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/38895900/2024-nfl-free-agent-ranking-top-25-buzz-predictions-burns-cousins-higgins\">available</a>, but the Chiefs will also have cap decisions on some of their own free agents at other positions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How much does <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\">Dallas Goedert</a>'s absence impact the Eagles' pass game, and who could get more looks with him out?</h2>\n<p><strong>Tim McManus, Eagles reporter:</strong> It's a blow to the offense, no doubt, but Philadelphia has a number of playmakers who can help make up for the loss. Expect a bulk of Goedert's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38834100/dallas-goedert-injury-philadelphia-eagles-ir-surgery\">workload</a> to fall to the receivers while he's out with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38829836/eagles-te-dallas-goedert-fractured-forearm-undergo-mri\">fractured right forearm</a>.</p>\n<p>During his five-game absence last season with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35032594/source-eagles-te-dallas-goedert-shoulder-miss-extended\">fracture in his shoulder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4050373/quez-watkins\">Quez Watkins</a> saw a spike in usage, with 27 of his 51 targets coming over that stretch. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones\">Julio Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917914/olamide-zaccheaus\">Olamide Zaccheaus</a> could be the biggest beneficiaries this time around. And this feels like an opportunity to get running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259545/dandre-swift\">D'Andre Swift</a> more involved in the passing game. He averaged 5.1 targets per game during his time with the Lions compared to 3.8 so far this season in Philly.</p>\n<p><a name=\"ol\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Which offensive line has been more dominant this season?</h2>\n<p><strong>Seth Walder, analytics writer:</strong> Though the Chiefs rank first in pass block win rate (77.4%) and the Eagles fifth (64.9%), I would say Philadelphia has the better overall offensive line. That's because the Eagles are much better in terms of run blocking, where they rank first (76.6%) in win rate compared to the Chiefs at 19th (70.0%).</p>\n<p>Then there is the Chiefs' penalty problem (hello, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034961/jawaan-taylor\">Jawaan Taylor</a>). They commit holding on 2.6% of their plays (second-highest rate in the NFL) compared to the Eagles at 0.5% (lowest). Lastly, that the Eagles can execute the tush push with such a high rate of efficiency is no trivial matter, and while Hurts plays a big role in that play, the offensive line does, too.</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p><a name=\"tushpush\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the secret to the Eagles' tush push?</h2>\n<p><strong>McManus:</strong> It's part technique -- the ground game is orchestrated by two of the best in the game in offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland and center <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14124/jason-kelce\">Jason Kelce</a> -- and part brawn, with guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035624/landon-dickerson\">Landon Dickerson</a> (6-foot-6, 332 pounds) and tackles <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15797/lane-johnson\">Lane Johnson</a> (6-6, 325 pounds) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4334215/jordan-mailata\">Jordan Mailata</a> (6-8, 365 pounds) leading the charge. And it certainly helps to have a quarterback who is a former powerlifter and can squat 600 pounds in Hurts.</p>\n<p>Put that all together, and you have a play that is borderline unstoppable, with Philadelphia converting 20 of its 22 attempts (91%) when needing one yard. The Eagles have also scored six touchdowns on sneaks this season, while the rest of the NFL has six <em>combined</em>.</p>\n<p><a name=\"defense\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the secret to the Chiefs' dominant defense this season?</h2>\n<p><strong>Teicher:</strong> There are several reasons, but perhaps the biggest is their young players in the secondary have grown up. Four of their regular defensive backs were drafted last year and are playing well, particularly cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426405/trent-mcduffie\">Trent McDuffie</a>, who is having a Pro Bowl-worthy season. Kansas City has limited opponent QBs to 6.1 yards per pass attempt, third lowest in the NFL.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs are so versatile in the secondary and on the defensive line that they can move players around to different spots to get favorable matchups. Spagnuolo has a lot of different ways to attack an opposing offense, and he mixes tactics often.</p>\n<p><a name=\"passrush\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Chiefs are tied for third in the NFL with 31 sacks on defense. Is their pass rush actually better than the Eagles this season?</h2>\n<p><strong>Walder:</strong> No, no, no. While the Chiefs have one more sack than the Eagles' 30, Philadelphia has superior pass rush overall. Led by players like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980504/haason-reddick\">Haason Reddick</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3693166/josh-sweat\">Josh Sweat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685759/jalen-carter\">Jalen Carter</a>, Philadelphia has a 53.7% pass rush win rate (fifth best) -- compared to the Chiefs way down at 35.5% (27th).</p>\n<p>So why do the Chiefs have more sacks, even if it's a slight difference? One reason is that they use blitzes and simulated pressures at higher than average rates, and both are effective tools. Kansas City has recorded a 9.9% sack rate when blitzing and 15.1% sack rate using simulated pressure this season. Don't get me wrong, they deserve credit for the sacks and the schematics. But if you're looking for the best pass rush in this game, it will be wearing green.</p>\n<p><a name=\"turnovers\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Which team is more likely to win the turnover battle?</h2>\n<p><strong>Aaron Schatz, NFL analyst:</strong> Mahomes and Hurts each have eight interceptions this season. <a href=\"https://www.ftndata.com/\">FTN Data</a> charting assigns Mahomes 12 interception-worthy throws and Hurts 11. That's pretty close. The Eagles have nine fumbles, and the Chiefs have eight. Again, pretty close.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>So let's flip to defense. The Chiefs have a couple more forced fumbles and one more forced interception. Still pretty close.</p>\n<p>The real difference here is probably sacks -- the plays most likely to lead to fumbles. The Chiefs have a better adjusted sack rate this season on both offense and defense. Hurts is likely to take more sacks than Mahomes, and thus is more likely to fumble. That means the Chiefs are more likely to win the turnover battle.</p>\n<p><a name=\"freeagents\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What are you hearing on some of the two teams' top pending free agents?</h2>\n<p><strong>Jeremy Fowler, national NFL reporter:</strong> Let's start with the Chiefs, whose big-money negotiations are basically on hold until after the season. Kansas City is focused on this championship run. The Chiefs tried with defensive tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones\">Chris Jones</a> in the 2023 offseason but couldn't find a sweet spot. Now Jones will be tough to keep. A franchise tag would cost around $32 million, which is steep for a one-year pact. And he might push $30 million per year as a free agent. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040432/ljarius-sneed\">L'Jarius Sneed</a> is a top corner in free agency and will also do well, but here's to expecting Kansas City to try to retain him sometime before mid-March. Sides had preliminary talks in the preseason.</p>\n<p>As for the Eagles, Jason Kelce is truly a year-to-year proposition. Should he want to return, the Eagles will be glad to pay him a one-year deal at the top of the center market, assuming he maintains his strong play. But he won't decide whether to play again until sometime this winter. While the Eagles were open to extending running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259545/dandre-swift\">D'Andre Swift</a>'s contract upon trading for him in late-April, he appears set on entering free agency. Running back is a team-friendly market right now due to immense talent, but Swift's big-play ability -- along with this season's proof that he's durable -- will get him paid.</p>\n<p><a name=\"rookies\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Which team had the better draft pick in 2023? Better overall class?</h2>\n<p><strong>Jordan Reid, NFL draft analyst:</strong> With Jalen Carter in the running for Defensive Rookie of the Year, he is the easy choice for best overall draft pick (No. 9 overall) between the two teams' classes. He was known for his ability to generate pressure at Georgia, and that has carried over into the NFL. His 22.2% pressure rate as an interior defender is the highest in the league. (On the Chiefs' side, second-rounder Rice has been reliable in the receiving corps.)</p>\n<p>The Eagles already arguably had the best roster in the NFL, and GM Howie Roseman brought in even more depth with this 2023 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38890027/10-best-2023-nfl-rookies-ranking-first-years-quarterbacks-cj-stroud-puka-nacua\">rookie class</a> that's seeing a significant amount of snaps. Carter, guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362805/tyler-steen\">Tyler Steen</a> and safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360386/sydney-brown\">Sydney Brown</a> have each received plenty of playing time through the midway point of the season.</p>\n<p><a name=\"sleeper\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Who is your favorite sleeper to put up big numbers in this matchup?</h2>\n<p><strong>Eric Moody, fantasy/sports betting writer:</strong> I'll go real deep with Eagles tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035115/albert-okwuegbunam\">Albert Okwuegbunam</a>. He's only rostered in 0.1% of ESPN fantasy leagues, but he could be a difference-maker as the Eagles look to fill the Goedert void.</p>\n<p>Goedert has averaged 5.7 targets per game this season, and Okwuegbunam has averaged 13.5 fantasy points per game in regular-season games over his career when he has had four or more targets. And in a game with a 45.5-point total, he may get more run with Goedert out. At 6-6 and 258 pounds, Okwuegbunam ran the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds at the 2020 combine, so he has the size and speed to make plays.</p>\n<p><a name=\"superbowl\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Which team has the better chance to get back to the Super Bowl in February?</h2>\n<p><strong>Field Yates, NFL analyst:</strong> The Eagles are the pick for me. While it might require more effort for Philadelphia to win its division than Kansas City -- Dallas is a superior team to any would-be challenger in the AFC West -- the NFC is a much weaker conference on the whole. There will be a different level of strain put on Philly in its first playoff game, and given that I think the Eagles will hold onto the NFC's No. 1 overall seed and get a bye, it'd only take one win to put them at home in the NFC Championship Game.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p><a name=\"picks\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Who will win the game?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi\">ESPN Football Power Index</a>'s simulations have the Chiefs winning 60.5% of the time and by an average of 3.6 points.

It's the second straight season in which he has gotten beat up every week, too, taking a sack on 7.5% of his dropbacks since the start of 2022.

  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>We've made it to the midway point of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings\">NFL season</a>. One-hundred and thirty-five of the 272 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/schedule\">regular-season games</a> we will see this season have been played; the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547524\">Chargers-Jets game</a> on \"Monday Night Football\" officially will get us 50% of the way through the campaign.</p>\n<p>It has been a weird season. Teams that have been anointed as the best in football typically have lost in ignominious fashion the next week. Breakout quarterbacks have fallen back to the pack. One of the two dramatic victories from the early slate Sunday came when <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044720/joshua-dobbs\">Joshua Dobbs</a> led the Vikings, his third team in three months, to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38825249/vikings-jaren-hall-concussion-josh-dobbs-qb\">win over the Falcons</a>. We sent the Chiefs and Dolphins to light up the scoreboard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547230\">in Germany</a> and had two of the league's most exciting offenses <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38825687/dolphins-tua-tagovailoa-shoulders-blame-loss-chiefs\">produce a total of 28 points</a>.</p>\n<p>If you don't know which teams are actually great or who should be the league MVP after nine weeks of football, well, join the club. Today, though, I'm going to take a crack at the latter problem and hand out my midseason awards.</p>\n<p>I'll be naming my picks and top two runners-up for Coach of the Year, Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year and Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year before finishing up with my MVP selection. Keep in mind this is my pick based on what each player has done through the first nine games of the season. I'm not projecting what these players will do over the rest of the season or what the actual voters will do at the end of the campaign, although I discuss a player's chances of winning the real hardware when things are said and done in January.</p>\n<p><a name=\"coy\"></a></p>\n<p>This is an annual exercise for me, as are my <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/38557860/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-4-2023-tua-mccaffrey-watt-parsons\">quarter-season awards every year</a> after Week 4. There are times when a player goes wire-to-wire and wins the quarter-, half- and full-season awards, but that won't be the case in 2023. Not one of my quarter-season picks is in the same spot here at the midway point, and none of my top-three MVP candidates through Week 4 is in the top three now. In a league full of upheaval, let's start with Coach of the Year, where I favor a leader who inexplicably has never won the award:</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Jump to an award:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38826896/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-9-2023-lamar-hurts-mahomes-tua#mvp\">Most Valuable Player</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38826896/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-9-2023-lamar-hurts-mahomes-tua#coy\">Best coach</a><br>\nBest rookies: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38826896/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-9-2023-lamar-hurts-mahomes-tua#oroy\">Offense</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38826896/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-9-2023-lamar-hurts-mahomes-tua#droy\">Defense</a><br>\nPlayers of the Year: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38826896/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-9-2023-lamar-hurts-mahomes-tua#opoy\">Offense</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38826896/ranking-nfl-mvp-candidates-awards-picks-week-9-2023-lamar-hurts-mahomes-tua#dpoy\">Defense</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Coach of the Year</h2>\n<p>This is typically an award that goes to the coach who exceeds his team's preseason over/under by the largest number of wins and takes a moribund team to the playoffs. By that criteria, the obvious candidate should be DeMeco Ryans, who has the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Texans</a> competing every week and winning well ahead of schedule in the AFC South. He's a viable candidate, but it's tough to pick a defensive-minded coach when the Houston defense ranks 25th in expected points added (EPA) per play. (If you're an unhappy Texans fan, there's good news coming later in the column.)</p>\n<p>I'm more inclined to give this award to coaches who have been around and either continue to do great work, bring through young talent or get more out of players who struggled elsewhere. All three of my coaches have been in their jobs for at least two full seasons, and they're impressing again in 2023.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>3. Nick Sirianni, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a></h2>\n<p>While even Eagles fans likely would acknowledge that the 2023 team doesn't look or play quite as dominant as the 2022 team did during the regular season, 8-1 is 8-1, right? The Eagles have the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/view/playoff\">best record in football</a>, and while they weren't exactly dominant during the fourth quarter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547522\">against the Cowboys</a> on Sunday, Sirianni's team did enough to hold on for a critical 28-23 victory.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Last year, I gave Sirianni credit for getting more out of veterans than coaches did in their prior stops, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047646/aj-brown\">A.J. Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034953\">C.J. Gardner-Johnson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2572841/james-bradberry\">James Bradberry</a> as very conspicuous examples. It's tougher this season because the Eagles didn't have the cap room to make many major additions, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259545/dandre-swift\">D'Andre Swift</a> is playing the best football of his career in Philadelphia. It's more about the young players, as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685759/jalen-carter\">Jalen Carter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4243956/reed-blankenship\">Reed Blankenship</a> have been forced into regular roles by departures and have exceeded expectations.</p>\n<p>Sirianni's comfort with going for it on fourth down and being aggressive on offense also transforms the Philadelphia offense and what it can do playcalling through all downs. Having a money play like the \"<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38577051/jalen-hurts-eagles-soaring-tush-push\">tush push</a>\" helps, but the Eagles are also willing to go for it in situations where even the tush push is out of the question, like the fourth-and-3 in field goal range that the Eagles converted on a pass to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\">Dallas Goedert</a> to help set up their first touchdown. Many coaches would have settled for an early field goal, yet Philly ended up needing those points late in the game. The Eagles are a special challenge for opponents, and Sirianni's aggressiveness aligns with analytics and with his team's strengths on offense.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/det.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>2. Dan Campbell, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a></h2>\n<p>One of my favorite things about soccer is how players will sign for new teams and refer to those teams as \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChelseaFC/status/1352943210440634368\">projects</a>.\" There's a beautiful pretentiousness there. Manchester City is a project. No player in the United States gets traded to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Brewers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Hornets</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-coyotes\">Coyotes</a> and talks about being excited to join their project. It's one team to another.</p>\n<p>If there's any NFL team that feels like a <i>project</i>, though, it's Campbell's Lions. We've seen them develop in real time, from the hopelessly frustrating 2021 team to their 2022 breakthrough in the second half. And now, in 2023, they're off to a bright start. At 6-2, the Lions have an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi/_/view/projections\">83.4% chance of winning the NFC North</a> for the first time since the league moved to the eight-division format in 2002 (via ESPN's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi/_/view/projections/sort/projections.probmakeplayoffs/dir/desc\">Football Power Index</a>). It would be Detroit's first division title since 1993, when Campbell was a high school junior in Clifton, Texas.</p>\n<p>Are the Lions a little worse than their record indicates? Maybe. Five of their six wins have come against teams with losing records that are collectively 15-27. They've gone 1-2 against likely playoff teams and been outscored by 37 points in those three games, with their one win coming <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547353\">over the Chiefs</a> in a game in which Kansas City seemed allergic to catching the football and one of the drops turned into a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4692025/brian-branch\">Brian Branch</a> pick-six. Tips and overthrows count, though, and the Lions have improved dramatically on defense, even without offseason additions <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115337/emmanuel-moseley\">Emmanuel Moseley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034953\">C.J. Gardner-Johnson</a> for most of the snaps.</p>\n<p>That's one of the most exciting things for the Lions and a good argument for why Campbell deserves consideration as one of the best coaches in football: His players continually get better. Last season, it was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4373825/penei-sewell\">Penei Sewell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4374302/amon-ra-st-brown\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> taking the leap on offense. This season, it's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372099/aidan-hutchinson\">Aidan Hutchinson</a> turning into one of the league's best edge rushers. Branch looks like an impact player. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361662/alim-mcneill\">Alim McNeill</a> looks like a new man. Even veteran <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043107/alex-anzalone\">Alex Anzalone</a> is making more plays and looks more confident than he has in years past. The Lions are a complete team, and I'm willing to give a fair amount of credit for that to their coach.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/pit.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>1. Mike Tomlin, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Steelers</a></h2>\n<p>If you've been reading this column for a few years now, you know me. I like rationality. I want to understand what's helping teams win or causing them to lose. I want there to be clean reasons things are occurring. Football is complicated, but if you look hard enough, you can usually find reasons under the hood to explain things.</p>\n<p>And then there's the Steelers, whose quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr\">ranks 29th in the league in QBR</a>. Whose lead running back is averaging 3.8 yards per carry. Whose defense is good, of course, but is 12th in points allowed per game. The turnover differential matters -- the Steelers are plus-8 through eight games -- but even that doesn't fully explain how they are over .500 while being outscored by 30 points and outgained in every single game.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>At this point, Tomlin feels inevitable as a coach who will bend the football universe to his whims and coax a successful season out of a flawed football team. These Steelers aren't like the old ones, as they've gone from being a team full of drafted-and-developed talent to one of the teams with the <a href=\" https://twitter.com/Jason_OTC/status/1697005933384130685\" target=\"_new\">least homegrown talent in football</a>, but we still see some of those draftees shine every year. First-round pick <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428990/broderick-jones\">Broderick Jones</a> has been in and out of the lineup, but second-round defenders <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426506/joey-porter-jr\">Joey Porter Jr</a>. and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426694/keeanu-benton\">Keeanu Benton</a> look like stars.

These awards shouldn't substitute as lifetime achievement awards or be makeup calls for mistakes from years past, but I don't see many people doing more with less than he is doing with his roster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Offensive Rookie of the Year</h2>\n<p>We've seen lots of rookies flash with big games or impressive stretches of play on the offensive side of the ball.

Of course, Dell's quarterback figures into the discussion here, too.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/atl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430807/bijan-robinson\">Bijan Robinson</a>, RB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Falcons</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Pick:</strong> No. 8</p>\n<p>Through four games, Robinson looked every bit like the generational running back prospect the Falcons hailed him as when they drafted him in Round 1. Since then, he has missed most of a game with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38728193/source-nfl-asks-falcons-bijan-robinson-health-line\">mysterious illness</a>, has averaged 4.0 yards per carry and has as many fumbles as touchdowns (two). He has been in a legitimate rotation with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4373626/tyler-allgeier\">Tyler Allgeier</a>, with each back racking up 15 touches in Sunday's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547518\">brutal loss to the Vikings</a>.</p>\n<p>The story the Falcons told about Robinson serving as some sort of hybrid star and slot weapon hasn't held up. Per NFL Next Gen Stats data, he has run 78 routes outside of the backfield, or about eight per game. Those routes have produced a total of 43 yards, for an average of 0.6 yards per route run. That figure ranks 185th out of the 202 players who have run at least 50 yards outside of the backfield this season. Robinson has done more out of the backfield, but he's averaging 1.0 yards per route run; he hasn't been an impact receiver on any sort of regular basis.</p>\n<p>He has been better as a pure runner, although most of his best work came over the first month of the season. He generated 106 rush yards over expectation (RYOE) across his first 103 attempts, which is notable when you consider that Allgeier has racked up minus-43 RYOE on his 116 carries. At the same time, consider that fellow rookie Achane leads the league with 236 RYOE on just 38 attempts. Achane is within 57 rushing yards of Robinson's total despite the fact the Dolphins draftee carried the ball just 38 times before <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38632567/dolphins-putting-rb-devon-achane-knee-ir-sources-say\">hitting injured reserve</a> with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>Robinson has been the best rookie back this season, although Gibbs has looked more explosive over the past month and Achane is set to return from injured reserve after the Dolphins return from their bye. Vikings fans might feel as if wideout <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429205/jordan-addison\">Jordan Addison</a> deserves to be ahead of Robinson in this top three, and I wouldn't begrudge them. Robinson was the prohibitive favorite to be Offensive Rookie of the Year before the season, but he feels closer to dropping out of the top three than to the lead spot right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lar.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426515/puka-nacua\">Puka Nacua</a>, WR, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Rams</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Pick:</strong> No. 177</p>\n<p>It was an inevitability that Nacua would see his numbers decline after the return of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977187/cooper-kupp\">Cooper Kupp</a>, but he's still way ahead of the competition. His 827 receiving yards is nearly 300 more than any other first-year receiver's, with Addison the only other rookie to top 500 receiving yards.

He has 25 catches on 44 targets for 326 yards and 2.4 yards per route run, while Addison is at 28 catches on 39 targets for 349 yards and 2.2 yards per route run. Addison has five touchdowns over that stretch, and Nacua's one weakness has been getting into the end zone. Still, he's on pace for nearly 1,600 receiving yards.

Even good rookies often are executing in sheltered offenses, but he is averaging more than 8.0 air yards per throw, which is the fifth most of any quarterback.  The only quarterbacks picking up first downs more often than Stroud are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy\">Brock Purdy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, could we really argue that Stroud is executing with great players around him? The offensive line has been banged up with injuries for most of the season. Houston's running game has been anonymous. His top two wideouts have been <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258173/nico-collins\">Nico Collins</a> and rookie third-rounder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4366031/tank-dell\">Tank Dell</a>, whom some teams saw topping out as a gadget player.

Former Cowboys wideout <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121409/noah-brown\">Noah Brown</a> had six catches for 153 yards and a touchdown.</p>\n<p><a name=\"droy\"></a></p>\n<p>Does Stroud have things to work on? Sure. He's completing only 62% of his passes, although that's still good for a completion percentage a half-point over expectation. And 19% of his passes have been off-target, which is the third-highest mark in football behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a> and Stafford. Stroud is way ahead of schedule, though, and he has turned the Texans into a must-watch on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Defensive Rookie of the Year</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Texans</a> fans hoping for a one-two punch from their first-round picks will be disappointed to hear <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685724/will-anderson-jr\">Will Anderson Jr.</a> is the last man out of the discussion in this category. He has only two sacks through nine games, but his underlying metrics are more promising. He has 22 pressures, which leads all rookies and ties him with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald\">Aaron Donald</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3693166/josh-sweat\">Josh Sweat</a> for 15th in the league. Anderson's nine knockdowns suggests he should have four sacks. Given that we aren't doubting the former college star's physical talent, he should produce more sacks as the year goes along if he continues to play this way.</p>\n<p>With Anderson out, there's a pretty clear three-man grouping at the top. I had to leave out two players for playing-time issues: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a> safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4692025/brian-branch\">Brian Branch</a> has two complete games, two absences and four games somewhere in between, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Steelers</a> corner <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426506/joey-porter-jr\">Joey Porter Jr</a>. was a backup for the first five weeks before moving into a regular role during the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547492\">win over the Rams</a> in Week 7.

I'm not sure that plan has gone particularly well, as they rank 24th in EPA per play, but there are a couple of promising players coming through the pipeline.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>The most conspicuous of those young players is Young, who leads all rookies with five sacks through Week 9. That includes two takedowns of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036378/jordan-love\">Jordan Love</a> on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547519\">against the Packers</a>. While neither was on a play in which Young created the initial pressure, his awareness and motor have played up as he has cleaned up plays.</p>\n<p>Young's 20 pressures ranks him second in the league among debuting players behind Anderson, so he has created some havoc playing downwind from the future Hall of Famer in the middle. Young was an undersize third-round pick and already is 25 years old, so the Rams probably can't count on him to turn into a superstar. If he can be a solid situational rusher who makes an average of just under $1.4 million per year on his rookie deal, though, he will be a nice find for L.A.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685759/jalen-carter\">Jalen Carter</a>, DT, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Pick:</strong> No. 9</p>\n<p>Carter, on the other hand, was a top-10 pick with a résumé as one of the best defensive players in all of college football.

Witherspoon has very conspicuously emerged as a force in the secondary, settling in and immediately looking like a veteran.</p>\n<p>After missing the Week 1 loss to the Rams with an injury, he has been virtually an every-down players. He made 11 tackles in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547432\">win over the Panthers</a>, but his coming-out party was in Week 4, when he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547456\">tormented the Giants</a> for 2 sacks, 2 tackles for loss, 3 quarterback knockdowns and a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/seattle-seahawks/post/_/id/36663/what-devon-witherspoons-breakout-performance-means-for-the-seahawks-defense\">97-yard pick-12</a> to put the game to bed. He followed that with a <a href=\"https://www.seahawks.com/video/2023-week-7-highlight-devon-witherspoon-best-hit-stick-tackles-on-rondale-moore\" target=\"_new\">viral hit on </a><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372485/rondale-moore\">Rondale Moore</a> against the Cardinals, albeit on a play that produced a first down.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>The Seahawks started with Witherspoon playing outside before moving him into the slot, which speaks to a flexibility that we almost never see from rookie corners. He has been great in both places. He has been targeted 51 times as the nearest defender in coverage, allowing just 5.4 yards per target while giving up two touchdowns in eight games. The only cornerbacks with 200 or more coverage snaps who have allowed fewer yards per target this season are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978935/xavien-howard\">Xavien Howard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040432/ljarius-sneed\">L'Jarius Sneed</a>.</p>\n<p><a name=\"dpoy\"></a></p>\n<p>Seattle still is a heavy zone team, so Witherspoon isn't the sort of traveling man-coverage defender we associate with the league's best corners, but he's off to a spectacular start.<img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Defensive Player of the Year</h2>\n<p>This is by far the toughest award to nail down. There are at least a half-dozen credible candidates to finish No. 1, let alone in the top three. I won't even be able to get to someone like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Ravens</a> defensive tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035245/justin-madubuike\">Justin Madubuike</a>, who is playing out of his mind and dominating games, or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Vikings</a> edge rusher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976560/danielle-hunter\">Danielle Hunter</a>, who leads the league in sacks.

I'm mad that I have to narrow this down to three.</p>\n<p>And yet, here we are. The last two players out are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a> defensive end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372099/aidan-hutchinson\">Aidan Hutchinson</a>, who has been the driving force behind his team's massive improvement on defense, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Cowboys</a> edge rusher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361423/micah-parsons\">Micah Parsons</a>, who is the single most unblockable player in the league at his best. Maybe I'm just waiting for Parsons to have that inevitable game where he takes over and single-handedly destroys the opposing offense. He's just outside the top three.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/pit.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045282/tj-watt\">T.J. Watt</a>, Edge, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a></h2>\n<p>As difficult as it has been to pin down a winning formula for the Steelers, one constant generally has been a big game from Watt, whose presence seems to be a prerequisite if they want to win. Since the start of 2022, Pittsburgh is 13-5 with Watt and 1-6 without him. If the Steelers can keep it close, he usually finds a way to get them over the hump.</p>\n<p>Back in an every-down role after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34579705/sources-pittsburgh-steelers-tj-watt-get-second-third-opinions-torn-pectoral\">tearing his pec</a> last season, Watt has 9.5 sacks and 18 knockdowns in nine games. His big plays have been essential for Pittsburgh in the division. Watt<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ_TenBNHF4\"> took a fumble to the house</a> in the 26-20 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547424\">win over the Browns</a> in Week 2, then recovered a fumble with 1:12 left in a four-point game <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547460\">against the Ravens</a> to set up a field goal in what would turn out to be a 17-10 win. (He finished that game by sacking <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> with 20 seconds to go.)</p>\n<p>A Watt interception started off the second half <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547492\">against the Rams</a> and set a flailing Steelers offense up on a short field for Pittsburgh's first touchdown in what would eventually become a 24-17 victory. He drops into coverage more often than other pass-rushers and actually adds value in doing so. He has seven interceptions in seven seasons, most of which occur when a quarterback who isn't expecting him to be in a throwing lane tosses the ball directly to the opposing team's best player.</p>\n<p>I tend to lean toward the most productive player in parsing out value for these awards. If I were picking the most essential player on any defense around the NFL if the team wants to play at a high level this season, Watt would be a viable choice.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lv.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916655/maxx-crosby\">Maxx Crosby</a>, Edge, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Las Vegas Raiders</a></h2>\n<p>I understand the reticence to hand this award to a player who isn't on a good defense. It's tough to watch the Raiders every week, let alone watch them and reward a player for being among the best in the NFL. If you have subjected yourself to watching the Raiders, though, there's been exactly one reward: getting to watch one of the league's best defensive players wreck shop up front each and every week.</p>\n<p>Crosby is unblockable for stretches every week. He leads the NFL with 40 pressures through nine games, serving as the only pass-rusher of note on a defense in which nobody else had more than one sack all season before Sunday <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547521\">against the Giants</a> and third-string quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240391/tommy-devito\">Tommy DeVito</a>. Crosby racked up three sacks and three tackles for loss in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38829509/raiders-win-antonio-pierce-coaching-debut\">Raiders victory that felt like a party</a> celebrating the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38791663/josh-mcdaniels-fired-las-vegas-raiders-bad-decisions-legacy-rebuild\">departure of Josh McDaniels</a>. It's not just getting after the quarterback, either. Crosby is tied for the league lead with 13 tackles for loss. Just the sheer numbers of plays he makes is impressive: No defensive lineman has more tackles against the run this season. He has played virtually every snap, which is essential given what little they have around him. Nobody does more with less around them.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cle.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122132/myles-garrett\">Myles Garrett</a>, Edge, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns</a></h2>\n<p>Maybe it's too simple to just give this award to the best player on the league's best defense. In terms of pass-rushing production per snap, I'm not sure anybody has been better than Garrett. After a sack in Sunday's shutout <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547514\">win over the Cardinals</a>, he has 9.5 sacks on 188 pass-rush opportunities this season.

(In both cases, he is behind Parsons.) ESPN's automated analysis suggests he has created a total of 11.5 sacks for himself and others this season, which is tied for the league lead with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones\">Chris Jones</a>.

He already has 619 receiving yards on throws outside the numbers this season, where opposing defenses will struggle to get safety help all the way to the sideline. He never topped 441 receiving yards on those throws in a single season during his time in Tennessee; he's on pace for 1,170 receiving yards outside the numbers, which would be the most any receiver has posted in a single season since 2008. The timing cutoff there is no accident, as the last receivers to rack up more receiving yards outside the numbers in a single year were <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578/reggie-wayne\">Reggie Wayne</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1433/randy-moss\">Randy Moss</a> in 2007.

I'll start by taking the non-quarterbacks out of the equation, although this is the sort of year in which a receiver or pass-rusher could break through if he sets a single-season record for receiving yards or sacks. With no quarterback breaking away from the pack, the door is open for a non-quarterback to do the spectacular. That's just the sort of thing that will only become apparent once we get to the very end of the season, though. Hill might be on pace for a 2,000-receiving-yard season, but he'll have to get there to garner serious support.</p>\n<p>Lots of quarterbacks are out of the discussion without a second thought. <b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a></b> has great numbers, but he has missed too many big throws for a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a> team that is 3-4 in advance of Monday's game against the Jets.

He could dominate from here on out and win the MVP, but I'm judging based on the first half of the season, and his first quarter was compromised by that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38425504/joe-burrow-aggravates-calf-injury-bengals-fall-0-2\">calf injury</a>.</p>\n<p>I was happy to endorse <b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy\">Brock Purdy</a></b>'s candidacy before the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">49ers</a>' current three-game losing streak, where his ability to create out of structure and without <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13241/trent-williams\">Trent Williams</a> on the field have come into question. Purdy is still averaging a league-high 9.1 yards per attempt and ranks second in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr\">QBR</a>, but he has thrown five interceptions over the past three weeks and doesn't offer much with his legs relative to the league's top quarterbacks.

That lack of execution cost the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jaguars</a> in their early-season loss to the Chiefs. He hasn't been bad, but his numbers are almost identical to what we saw him from over the full season a year ago, suggesting he's not playing as well as the guy who broke out over the second half of 2022.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a></b> leads the league in QBR and continues to make impossible throws for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Bills</a> every week, but he also has thrown nine interceptions, including an underthrown Cover 2 shot against the Bengals <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547523\">on Sunday night</a> on a pass that never should have been thrown. Allen's hero ball can win the Bills games, but it also cost them the Week 1 contest against the Jets when he turned the ball over four times.

We'll see whether <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4385690/dalton-kincaid\">Dalton Kincaid</a> is that playmaker in this offense during the second half.</p>\n<p>The last quarterback out is <b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a></b>, who has had one standout game in six tries since that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38481606/miami-dolphins-score-70-points-vs-broncos-record-day\">70-20 demolition of the Broncos</a> in Week 3. That game came against the lowly Panthers, and while I'm not entirely in agreement with the argument that the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Dolphins</a> have beat up on bad teams and struggled against playoff-caliber opposition, it's hard to make a case that he has been an MVP-caliber quarterback during the losses to the Chiefs, Eagles and Bills. Tagovailoa's offensive line is beat up and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372016/jaylen-waddle\">Jaylen Waddle</a> has been playing through myriad injuries, but at this point, I might pick Hill as the MVP candidate from this offense ahead of Tagovailoa.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a></h2>\n<p>After getting the pool down to three, Mahomes is an easy choice in the third spot. It might be unfair to judge the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35626954/chiefs-qb-patrick-mahomes-wins-2nd-career-nfl-mvp-award\">reigning champ</a> by his own lofty standards. While voters typically don't pick a defending MVP to retain his title after his numbers decline, I shouldn't be held to those same standards. Mahomes has been excellent this season.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> struggling to be the week-to-week dominator we saw last season, Mahomes has often been asked to find solutions on his own without resorting to the legendary rapport he has with Kelce on scramble drills. It's a credit to the future Hall of Fame quarterback that he has been able to adjust. He ranks fourth in the NFL in QBR on throws made in 2.5 seconds or less. He has also been devastating as a scrambler, running for a league-high 16 first downs while scrambling. His average first down while scrambling has come with 10 yards to go.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>Mahomes' ability to sense that he can get the first down as a runner without taking a big hit is otherworldly. When he goes, he almost always picks up a first down, even on third-and-forever. It's one of his two secret superpowers alongside movement within the pocket. The average quarterback is sacked on nearly 23% of pressures, but Mahomes is sacked on only 12% of his pressures. That's the best mark in the league.</p>\n<p>We can blame drops or a lack of playmakers at wide receiver for some of their problems, but the Chiefs have drifted in and out of too many games on offense for Mahomes to feel like an ideal candidate here. Sunday was an example, as the Chiefs scored 14 points on two long drives against the Dolphins and otherwise gained 110 yards on the other seven meaningful drives they attempted in Germany. Nobody on the planet is better at manufacturing answers than Mahomes, but even he seems to be struggling with Kansas City's inconsistency at times.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a></h2>\n<p>If you want to know how valuable someone really is to your football team, watch them get up limping from a pile and see what you feel. Eagles fans had to endure that pain for a minute Sunday when Hurts <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38829467/jalen-hurts-guts-pain-earns-gritty-eagles-win\">took a hit to his knee and limped to the sideline</a> before halftime against the Cowboys. After the break, the fourth-year star returned to the lineup and looked no worse for wear. It wasn't always pretty, but he threw for 207 yards and two touchdowns and added another on the ground in a 28-23 Eagles victory.</p>\n<p>The nearly unprecedented gains Hurts made as a passer over the past few seasons aren't going anywhere. Having great receivers helps, but he continues to be one of the league's most accurate quarterbacks. His 68.9% completion percentage comes in 6.9 percentage points ahead of expectation by the NFL Next Gen Stats model, which is the best mark for any quarterback. He  has a reputation for being able to damage teams outside of the pocket, but his 72.4 QBR inside the pocket ranks as the NFL's best mark this season.</p>\n<p>Of course, Hurts also makes a significant difference as a runner, in part because of his essential role in the operation of the league's most devastating play. He has run for 39 first downs this season, 22 of which have come on designed runs of 2 or fewer yards. That's right in line with what we saw a year ago, when he ran the ball for a league-high 67 first downs. His ability as a scrambler gets lost in the proverbial cloud of dust that comes with the tush push and how it changes Philly's offense, but he has added 11 more first downs scrambling this season.</p>\n<p>The one issue holding Hurts back is his propensity for the negative play. He has improved his sack rate from 7.6% a year ago to 6.2% this season, but the interceptions have been a concern. He had just six picks on 460 pass attempts last season, but he already has eight in about half of a season in 2023. That includes three interceptions in a frustrating loss to the Jets last month. Hurts is still a dazzling football player and essential to the cause in Philadelphia, but he's just ever so slightly behind my top pick.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Ravens</a></h2>\n<p>Jackson is getting plenty of help from his defense, and we still need him to stay healthy deep into December and January after missing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35991094/lamar-jackson-frustrated-injury-questions-let-get-real\">most of those months in 2021 and 2022 with injuries</a>. Just based off the first half of the season, though, I believe he's the one left standing and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38740844/how-lamar-jackson-fuels-baltimore-ravens-planned-unplanned-offense\">best player in football</a> through two months.</p>\n<p>As a passer, Jackson has <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38721114/ravens-lamar-jackson-not-content-dismantling-lions\">made major strides</a>. He leads the league in completion percentage (71.5%) despite throwing downfield at one of the highest rates. He averages a league-high 10.2 yards per throw off play-action, and he has picked apart defenses dominating in the intermediate zone. On throws traveling 11 to 20 yards in the air, his 94.4 QBR is the second-best mark in football, trailing only Herbert's. He ranks third in QBR under pressure.</p>\n<p>And as a runner, Jackson hasn't lost much off his peak. He is running for a league-high 48.9 yards per game, which tops all quarterbacks. His 32 first downs is  second only to Hurts, who has the benefit of steadily operating a play that generates free first downs about 95%of the time. Jackson's 19 runs of 10 or more yards is by far the most of any passer in the league. He ran for 47 gains of 10-plus yards in his MVP campaign, and no other quarterback in recent memory has topped 33 such runs in a single campaign. He's on pace for 36 this season.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Jackson has also been just slightly better at protecting the football and avoiding drive-stalling plays than his Eagles counterpart. He has taken sacks on 6.8% of his dropbacks, right in line with Hurts' 6.2%. The big difference is Hurts has thrown eight interceptions to Jackson's three, albeit with 52 more pass attempts. They each have two fumbles, although Hurts has lost both of his fumbles, while Jackson has not. With Jackson coming in as a more effective runner and protecting the ball as well as any other quarterback, his all-around game leaves me to pick him No. 1 here.</p>\n<p>Is that enough to propel Jackson to the MVP title? Probably not. MVPs typically need to win their division, if not claim the top seed in their conference. That'll be easier said than done in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings\">white-hot AFC North</a>, where all four teams won their games this weekend. Jackson has been <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38633335/lamar-jackson-ravens-wrs-better-5-drop-game\">let down at times by drops</a>, and even he has gone through stretches when it felt as if Baltimore was caught playing with its food before losing in frustrating fashion to the Colts and Steelers, but there's no perfect candidate right now. Jackson has minimized mistakes, improved as a passer, kept a lot of what people liked about him as a runner and made enough big plays to win each week. That's enough to be in the lead for the MVP balloting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video></p>\n<p>FRANKFURT, Germany -- Walking around the heart of downtown Frankfurt, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> is nearly everywhere you look.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> quarterback has a display at the adidas store in the MyZeil shopping center. His jersey hangs in most sporting goods stores, his face adorns nearly every piece of marketing the NFL has used in preparation for its Frankfurt debut.</p>\n<p>He's almost impossible to miss, but that won't be the case Sunday.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> prepare to face the defending champion Chiefs (9:30 a.m. ET, NFL Network), their main priority on defense is stopping the league's reigning MVP.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>\"Just trying to keep him from having an unbelievable game,\" defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. \"And try and hopefully limit the improvised plays, where he starts scrambling around, making great throws on the run, guys getting open, him pulling the ball down and running it for critical first downs. He's really tough.</p>\n<p>\"You've got to defend the play they call in the huddle, which is hard enough, and then you have to defend the play that he creates after the first one breaks down a little bit.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes' career highlight reel is a series of extended plays, throws from difficult-to-replicate arm angles, and no-look passes.</p>\n<p>It makes life difficult for opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>Since his first season as a starter in 2018, Mahomes leads all active players in passing yards (16,187), passing touchdowns (121) and quarterback rating (69.4) when his time to throw is greater than 2.5 seconds. He's a prolific off-script passer, to the point where even if a defense does everything correctly, he has a tendency to complete a pass or scramble for a first down.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>\"Yeah, obviously sometimes he looks like a magician with some of the things he does,\" Dolphins linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242975/jaelan-phillips\">Jaelan Phillips</a> said. \"But at the end of the day, you just have to be disciplined in your rush. I think that's the biggest thing when it comes to edges at least, is keeping him contained, not letting him roll out of the pocket.</p>\n<p>\"It can definitely be very frustrating, because you can rush, win, do everything perfectly and he gets the ball off. Or you could be running around, he's running around for five, six seconds and he makes some crazy throw to [tight end] <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> down the field. I think we have to expect that to happen and know that's going to happen a few times during the game, but not let it discourage us. We just have to keep rushing no matter what happens.\"</p>\n<p>Former Chiefs receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>, now in his second season with the Dolphins, was often a benefactor of Mahomes' ability to escape during their four seasons together.</p>\n<p>Hill has offered one major piece of advice to his defensive teammates for when plays break down and Mahomes starts to scramble: Find Kelce.</p>\n<p>\"What I've been telling the guys to do is just find Kelce,\" he said. \"If you allow Kelce to get open, he's like the energy of that team. Although Pat is all-world, if he finds Kelce and Kelce just catches a 2-yard pass, he somehow finds energy in that and gets that team going. They do a great job of it. And they did a great job of coaching it also whenever I was there. They got a whole PowerPoint on it and everything.\"</p>\n<p>Since 2018 Kelce leads all players with 296 receptions on passes that take longer than 2.5 seconds to attempt. The Dolphins will employ multiple coverages to limit Kelce's impact, including possibly shadowing him with safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4373809/jevon-holland\">Jevon Holland</a> or cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey\">Jalen Ramsey</a>.</p>\n<p>\"They've got weapons left and right,\" Holland said. \"They just get the ball to their primary guys when they need to, and they make it happen. Then of course, Pat Mahomes is special. He can scramble, extend plays, use his feet, use his mind, eyes downfield.</p>\n<p>\"It definitely adds a unique dynamic to their offense. ... It's exciting game-planning for them, because it's something that you kind of don't see a lot.\"</p>\n<p>Dolphins players and coaches insist there isn't necessarily a specific key to stopping Mahomes -- but to even have a chance at it, you have to stick to your plan even as the Chiefs' plan evolves.</p>\n<p>If your assignment is to cover, then cover, as linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915507/jerome-baker\">Jerome Baker</a> said, and if you're supposed to rush, then rush.</p>\n<p>When those lines get blurred, Mahomes thrives.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"Don't try to do too much. It gets people in trouble,\" Baker said. \"If you're a coverage guy and you're trying to rush him -- now you're leaving somebody wide open. So just real simple, just do your job and we'll be all right.\"</p>\n<p>The Dolphins' defense has seen mixed results on extended plays this season. It has allowed the 15th-best quarterback rating (41.3) on plays with a time to throw longer than 2.5 seconds. Opposing quarterbacks sport the third-highest completion percentage over expectation on such throws (5.1%) and 10th-highest yards per attempt (8.4).</p>\n<p>However, Miami also has recorded 26 sacks on such plays, which ranks fourth in the NFL, and has contacted the quarterback 55 times, which leads the league.</p>\n<p>Linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116733/bradley-chubb\">Bradley Chubb</a> said keeping Mahomes contained in the pocket is \"way easier said than done,\" and the Dolphins are prepared for him to find some degree of success Sunday regardless of what they do to slow him down.</p>\n<p>But Miami also expects to find success of its own -- as long as it remains true to its assignments.</p>\n<p>\"It's not going to be an easy task, but that's the goal,\" Chubb said. \"We might not do it every play. We might not do it half the plays. But at the end of the day, that's the goal to keep him in that pocket. And even if we don't, I know the guys on the back end are going to do their jobs to hold up, to reroute, to plaster and all that type of stuff. It's more about team defense and not so much getting caught up in, 'Oh, if he escapes the pocket, it's going to hurt us,' because he's going to do that.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's one of the best for a reason, so he's going to do that. He's going to be in those positions to make plays, we've just got to be in better position.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Hello, November (aka Daniel Dopp's birthday month)! It's going to be a jam-packed couple of weeks with plenty of celebrations, announcements and surprises.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Instead, let's focus on Week 9! There are four teams on bye, one giant matchup in Germany, absolute chaos in Vegas, and another primetime outing for Gang Green.</p>\n<p>Between each of those focal points there remain a plethora of props that pop. Let's dig in and start making that holiday bank.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>QB Props</strong></h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/2565969.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2565969/taylor-heinicke\">Taylor Heinicke</a> OVER 13.5 rushing yards (vs. Vikings)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Liz:</strong> He's baaaack! And I'm hyped for the return. Heinicke may not be a sterling passer, but he's a wonderfully gutty player, who isn't afraid to use his legs. The pride and joy of Old Dominion, Heinicke averaged nearly 11 rushing yards per game as a Commandeer in 2022. In his first appearance as a Falcon, he scampered for 14 rushing yards against a formidable Titans front. Noting Arthur Smith's attachment to the ground game, I expect Heinicke to take off at least four or five times. The Vikings have allowed the fifth-most rushing yards to opposing QBs (an average of 12.8/game). I think Heinicke flirts with 15 rushing yards in his first home start.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3139477.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> OVER 0.5 interceptions (vs. Dolphins)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> I am so hyped for Heinicke's first start in Atlanta. Let's open up this Falcon's offense a little bit, am I right? This year's first Germany game between the Dolphins and Chiefs should have some fireworks, including on the defensive side of the ball. The Dolphins defense only has four interceptions on the year, but they just got <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey\">Jalen Ramsey</a> back and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978935/xavien-howard\">Xavien Howard</a> has a chance at playing this week, making it the first time these two superstars have played next to each other this season. Mahomes has thrown eight picks in eight games. It's likely this one will be a shootout with the implied total at 50.5, tied for the highest of the week. That narrative means we'll see plenty of action through the air and given the what at least one pick for this Dolphins defense.</p>\n<h3>RB Props</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4242335.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242335/jonathan-taylor\">Jonathan Taylor</a> longest rush OVER 15.5 yards (at Panthers)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>We've started to see JT rediscover his explosiveness over the last few games, having big runs of 24 and 42 yards against the Browns and Saints. Luckily for us, he gets the Panthers this week and their defense is not nearly as intimidating as his last two matchups. The Panthers allow 139.4 rushing yards per game, but I don't really want to take a rushing yards prop for Taylor knowing that Moss is still in the mix. A longest run prop is little more independent of Moss' touches within this backfield, so let's look at how many other RBs they've allowed to break off a 15 yard run so far this year: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4421446/craig-reynolds\">Craig Reynolds</a> (twice), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4373626/tyler-allgeier\">Tyler Allgeier</a> (twice), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035538/david-montgomery\">David Montgomery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576414/raheem-mostert\">Raheem Mostert</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4048244/alexander-mattison\">Alexander Mattison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567048/kenneth-walker\">Kenneth Walker III</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430807/bijan-robinson\">Bijan Robinson</a> and Christoper Brooks.

Despite the aforementioned obstacles, however, Walker still managed to rip off a 45-yard run. The dude has \"it.\" He's cleared the above line in all but one game (Week 2) this season. Sure, the matchup at Baltimore is tough (the Ravens are allowing a YPC of 4.1) but Walker is bolstered by a pair of incredible field stretchers that are getting healthier.

Douglas reeled in a team-high five balls for 25 yards in that effort. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045523/kendrick-bourne\">Kendrick Bourne</a> (ACL) done for the year and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576623/devante-parker\">DeVante Parker</a> dealing with a concussion, the speedy slot man should see an increase in opportunities. He also draws a fire matchup this weekend versus Washington.

I'm in total agreement with you and love the call to take the over!</p>\n<p>I've made a public declaration that one of my props for the rest of the season is going to be around <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a> as he chases 2,000 receiving yards. This week was tough to choose, but I ended up settling on going OVER 93.5 receiving yards. Listen, Tyreek is unlike any other WR in the game, so it's tough to compare him to other WRs who have faced the Chiefs. Only two WRs have hit this mark -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242433/joshua-palmer\">Joshua Palmer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk</a> -- so for another other player in the NFL right now, I'd probably take the under. But marrying Tyreek's speed with Tua's affinity to get him the ball and the way the offense moves him around to keep defenses on their heels, I just can't bet against the dude yet. Hill has hit this mark in 5 of his 8 games this year and with the afformentioned total of 50.5, that implies a lot of offense. I'll be watching the Dolphins game closely after I get done hosting Daily Wager this Sunday from 9-10 a.m. ET on ESPN2. Come hang with me for a little bit if you're free.</p>\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>FRANKFURT, Germany -- The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> turned over their wide receiving group in the two seasons since trading <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>. As they're preparing to face Hill and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> on Sunday in Frankfurt (9:30 a.m. ET, NFL Network), here's a peek at how that's going: The Chiefs' wide receivers have 33 more catches and 171 more yards this season than Hill alone.</p>\n\n\n<p>While the Chiefs did trade for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035004/mecole-hardman-jr\">Mecole Hardman Jr</a>. two weeks ago, they are otherwise sticking with the receivers they have for the rest of the season. They declined to acquire a receiver at this week's trade deadline, instead remaining hopeful improvement will come from within.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We're going to be OK there,\" coach Andy Reid said. \"We just keep getting better all the way along. It's not just a wide receiver thing. It's all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"A week ago we were saying how good they did, so we just keep the consistency going on the offensive side is what we need to do all the way around, not just wide receivers.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs were dismal offensively in last week's loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>. They were held without a touchdown for only the third time with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> at quarterback and had a season-low nine points. <inline2></p>\n<p>A couple of big dropped passes by wide receivers contributed. One by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a> was in the end zone and cost the Chiefs a fourth-quarter touchdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs' wide receivers are 18th in the league in catches (94) and 14th in yards (1,185). Those numbers aren't significantly different than what the wide receivers delivered in the first eight games last season, but the situation feels more desperate.</p>\n\n\n<p>Though the Chiefs are 6-2, they've scored seven fewer points per game than at the same junction of the 2022 season.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We've kind of built our identity through the season,\" Mahomes said. \"Obviously this is a little slower than we have the year before, but we have a lot of young guys who have showed a lot of great flashes, so I know the talent is there. It's about how can we put those guys in the right position to go out and execute.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It's little things in this league, and people think it's a big gap and we try to explain that if you don't execute those little things, these games are a lot closer than you're used to seeing. For us, we have to continue to get better and better each week and see where we can go from that.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs heading into the season expected Moore, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> to be big contributors. That hasn't happened. They've combined for 45 catches, 504 yards and three touchdowns.</p>\n\n\n<p>Valdes-Scantling has only 12 receptions, but a healthy 18.9 yards-per-catch average, the second-best of his career.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"There are going to be games where [opposing defenses] don't want me to get big plays and that's just the reality of it,\" Valdes-Scantling said. \"They're going to do anything they can to stop me from going 1-for-80. They'll let <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis [Kelce</a>] or whoever catch 10 balls before they let me catch one. That's just been the name of the game. I've been one of the better deep threats in the league my whole career. I take it with pride and I see the respect that I get from defenses across the league.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Moore emerged from training camp looking as if he would be the Chiefs' leading wide receiver, but since then often appears as if a stranger to Mahomes. Moore has just 14 catches on 27 targets. He is third among wide receivers in receptions and yards.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Just do a better job of finishing the opportunities that I get,\" Moore said when asked what improvements he wants to make in the second half of the season. \"When they come, just make the play.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Never really satisfied. Like I said, there's more that I can get from my opportunities and just looking to build on that the rest of the season.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a> has been the most productive of the wide receivers. He had one of the big drops against the Broncos but as a rookie leads the team's wide receivers by a wide margin in catches (30), yards (361) and touchdowns (3).</p>\n<p>Rice's playing time has expanded in recent weeks, which means the Chiefs have bigger plans for him.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I think he's doing a really good job of just doing what he's supposed to do and making the plays that he's supposed to make, not trying to be anything that he's not,\" Valdes-Scantling said. \"You see a lot of rookies come in and try to do too much and can't figure out the right thing to do and the wrong thing to do. He's just been doing his job and it's been paying off for him.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's a quiet kid who listens to what he's told to do. He always wants to learn. He's always taking notes and it shows. Obviously, Pat trusts him to keep giving him the ball.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video></p>\n<p>FRANKFURT, Germany -- When <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a> lines up Sunday (9:30 a.m. ET, NFL Network) to face the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a> for the first time since Kansas City traded him on March 23, 2022, it will raise an interesting question: Is the Dolphins' version of Hill better than the Chiefs' version?</p>\n<p>As far as individual milestones, no stat speaks louder than Hill's current pace of reception yards per game, which is a league-best 126.8. If he continues at that pace, he would finish with 2,154, which would break Calvin Johnson's single-season receiving record (1,964) set in 2012 when the regular season was 16 games.</p>\n<p>Hill was a key member of two Super Bowl teams in Kansas City, including Super Bowl LIV in Miami where he had nine catches for 105 yards in a 31-20 win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a>.</p>\n<p>Hill benefited from elite quarterback play with both teams, catching passes from two-time MVP <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> in Kansas City and from current MVP favorite <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a> in Miami. And the Chiefs' Andy Reid and Dolphins' Mike McDaniel are considered two of the top playcallers in the NFL.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Hill's nickname is Cheetah, but Reid isn't sure that's entirely accurate.</p>\n<p>\"He's really not a cheetah, because a cheetah goes with a burst and then rests for eight hours,\" Reid said. \"That's not [Hill]. He can keep going over and over again.</p>\n<p>\"It's pretty amazing.''</p>\n<p>So which version is better? Here, with help from ESPN Stats & Info, is a comparison of Hill circa 2016-21 in Kansas City and Hill from the beginning of the 2022 season in Miami. Hill weighs in with his thoughts and ESPN fantasy football/NFL analyst Mike Clay picks a winner.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>Individual stats</h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Chiefs:</b> Hill improved in receptions in each of his six seasons with the Chiefs, with the exception of 2019, when he missed four games because of an injury. He went from mostly a gadget-type of player as a rookie in 2016 to their unquestioned No.1 wideout with his first 1,000-yard season in 2017. He hit his high in yards (1,479) in 2018, when Mahomes took over as the starter. In 2021, his final season with the Chiefs, Hill complained about running shorter routes and had his lowest average yards per catch (11.2), other than his rookie season. <i>-- Chiefs reporter Adam Teicher</i></p>\n<p><b>Dolphins:</b> In 25 games with the Dolphins, Hill has accumulated more yards than he did during any 25-game span with the Chiefs. He leads the NFL with eight TDs of at least 40 yards over that span, and he's fourth in yards after the catch. On Sunday, Hill became the first player since 1961 to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards through eight games. <i>-- Dolphins reporter Marcel Louis-Jacques</i></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<h2>Team success</h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Chiefs:</b> It's no coincidence the Chiefs began their current streak of seven straight AFC West championships the year they drafted Hill (he was first-team All Pro as a rookie). The Chiefs had never won back-to-back division championships until this streak started, and starting Mahomes in 2018 solidified the Chiefs' standing among the league's best. The Chiefs reached the AFC Championship Game in each of Hill's final four seasons and won two of them, losing the other two in overtime. <i>--Teicher</i></p>\n<p><b>Dolphins:</b> The Dolphins are averaging 453.3 yards of offense, which puts them on pace to break the 2011 New Orleans Saints' single-season record of 7,474 yards (although the Saints did it in 16 games).</p>\n<p>The Chiefs went one-and-done in the playoffs in Hill's first year, just as the Dolphins did last season. But Hill helped get Miami to the playoffs for the first time since 2016, while the Chiefs were no strangers to the postseason. <i>-- Louis-Jacques</i></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>As a teammate</h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Chiefs:</b> Hill has at times been critical of the Chiefs since being traded to the Dolphins, saying the Chiefs didn't always take full advantage of his talent. But other than some grumbling in his final season in Kansas City about running shorter routes, he mostly kept any frustration to himself so as to not disrupt the locker room. Chiefs tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> indicated after the trade he appreciated that about Hill.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n<p>Reid and Mahomes, meanwhile, said they loved Hill and understood any frustration. \"When he's a competitor like that, you want to have a chance to impact the games,\" Mahomes said after the trade. \"I know he wanted to get the ball as much as possible to help us win. It wasn't a selfish thing. We were winning football games, especially at the end of the season, so I don't think he really brought that to our attention.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes also said on his weekly radio hit that Hill's work ethic rubbed off on him. \"I don't think everybody sees how hard that man works,\" he said. \"He's one of the hardest working guys I've ever been around.\" <i>--Teicher</i></p>\n<p><b>Dolphins:</b> Hill's on-field credentials, including his status as maybe the fastest player in the NFL, preceded him in Miami, but Tagovailoa said he didn't know what to expect from Hill as a teammate.</p>\n<p>\"What really surprised me was who he was as a leader, his work ethic, and then how he takes ownership of what is asked of him to do,\" Tagovailoa said. \"And then it's almost like a trickle-down effect for a lot of the guys in his room. They respect him as a player, as a person to take advice from him and follow his lead.\"</p>\n<p><alsose></alsose></p>\n<p>Hill has been named a captain by his teammates in each of his two seasons in Miami.</p>\n<p>McDaniel once tongue-in-cheek called out Hill last training camp for not having the fastest registered speed at the team's practice that day.</p>\n<p>The next day, Hill was clocked at 23 mph -- which would be the fastest ball-carrier speed recorded by NextGen Stats since 2020 if it happened during a game.</p>\n<p>\"He did some really remarkable stuff last year, but he's taken everything to another level this year with regard to the details and the fundamentals to the daily approach to being a captain and to leading,\" McDaniel said. \"So it's an exciting time, and I think nothing's better than going out to a practice field when Tyreek's out there, because what people miss is yeah, he's fast -- I want to see somebody move faster in practice during the week than him.\" <i>-- Louis-Jacques</i></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<h2>Hill's thoughts</h2>\n\n\n<p>\"I just know a whole lot more now,\" he said. \"Obviously, when you come into the league you're trying to find where you fit and understand how the game is played, but now I've been able to learn from other veterans in the past locker room that I was in and apply it here.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm kind of glad that [the trade] happened,\" Hill added. \"Obviously the situation that I'm in is great. I've got great teammates. My family is from Miami, and also, I accomplished one of my goals of being one of the highest-paid in the league. So, everything's great.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>And the winner is ...</h2>\n\n\n<p>In six seasons with the Chiefs, Hill maxed out with a 25% target share (9.4 per game), 111 receptions and 1,479 receiving yards. He proceeded to clear all of those marks - 30% target share (10.0 per game), 119 receptions and 1,710 yards - in his first season in Miami. And that was despite Tagovailoa missing essentially five full games, which can't be overstated considering all 15 of Hill's touchdowns since joining Miami have come from Tagovailoa.</p>\n<p>Speaking of touchdowns, Hill did have his best TD season in Kansas City (17 in 2020), but he very well could match or clear that mark in 2023 (eight in eight games).</p>\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the best evidence Hill has been better and more valuable in Miami is how each offense has changed. Whereas the Chiefs proceeded to easily lead the NFL in passing yards and win the Super Bowl without Hill last season, Miami's offense leapt to sixth in the league in yardage -- it's first top-10 showing in the category since some fella named Dan Marino led them to an eighth-place finish in 1995. Miami is first in offensive points and yardage in 2023 and hasn't led both of those categories since the Don Shula/Marino duo pulled it off in 1984.</p>\n<p>Hill was an absolute superstar and a huge part of the Chiefs' success during his time in Kansas City. However, he wasn't fully maximized until arriving in Miami and has taken his game to another level over the past year and a half.</p>\n<p><b>The winner:</b> Miami's Tyreek Hill</p>\n<p><i>--Clay</i></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

They have the NFL's second-ranked scoring defense at 16.1 points a game, and if that keeps up, the team will stay in just about any game. And there's reason to believe it will continue. The pass rush has surged in the past two games, giving the Chiefs 28 sacks for the season, tied for second most with the Bills, three behind the league-leading Ravens. Even in Sunday's otherwise hideous loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>, the defense gave the Chiefs some hope into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p><b>Why they might be vulnerable:</b> The offense hasn't been as good as in previous years, and at times it has been awful. Wide receiver production outside of rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a> has been disappointing. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> were expected to be major contributors but have mostly been no-shows through half a season, combining for 45 catches, 504 yards and three touchdowns. Moore dropped a perfectly placed touchdown pass in the loss to the Broncos that could have sparked a comeback. Mahomes hasn't been up to the task of lifting the passing game. He is headed toward a career-worst statistical season. He has his lowest passer rating (95.8) and is on pace for 17 interceptions, which would easily surpass the most in his career (13 in 2021). He's on pace for a TD-to-interception ratio of less than 2:1, which would also be a career worst. <i>-- Teicher</i></p>\n<p><b>ESPN BET :</b> The Chiefs are the +250 betting favorite to win the AFC and +500 favorite to win the Super Bowl.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/mia.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>Dolphins</h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Why the Dolphins have a legitimate shot at the top seed:</b> Simply put, offensive firepower. The Dolphins haven't cracked 100 rushing yards in three straight games, and they lead the NFL in rushing at 151.8 yards per game. While their ground game has come back to earth without <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429160/devon-achane\">De'Von Achane</a>, the Dolphins continue to lead the league in passing (301.5) and scoring (33.9 points per game). There are four players on this offense -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576414/raheem-mostert\">Raheem Mostert</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372016/jaylen-waddle\">Jaylen Waddle</a> and Achane -- who can score from anywhere on the field. Miami's defense also got a shot in the arm with the return of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey\">Jalen Ramsey</a>, which should boost a unit that has been middle-of-the-pack through eight games. Ramsey had an interception and forced fumble in his season debut Sunday.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p><b>Why might they be vulnerable:</b> Miami's offensive line, while markedly improved from the past two seasons, has suffered injuries to four starters. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15821/terron-armstead\">Terron Armstead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3821577/connor-williams\">Connor Williams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2138951/rob-hunt\">Rob Hunt</a> should return sooner rather than later, but this unit has often been challenged by injuries in the past. A three-game stretch against the Cowboys, Ravens and Bills to end the season might also prove difficult during a time of year when playoff seeding is typically determined -- although two of those games are at home, where the Dolphins have not lost since Dec. 25, 2022. Miami has been criticized this season for losing the only two games it has played against teams with a winning record, and while that won't matter much in terms of qualifying for the playoffs, those are the type of matchups the team has to win to clinch the AFC's top seed. <i>-- Louis-Jacques</i></p>\n<p><b>ESPN BET:</b> The Dolphins are +400 to win the AFC and +850 to win the Super Bowl.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/jax.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>Jaguars</h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Why the Jaguars have a legitimate shot at the top seed:</b> You wouldn't have expected defense to be the top reason, but that's the case. The Jaguars lead the league in takeaways (18) and interceptions (11), are second in pass breakups (33), and fourth in rush defense (79.3 yards per game). LB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915239/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> (9 sacks) and CB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239833/darious-williams\">Darious Williams</a> (NFL-high 8 pass breakups) are having the best seasons of their careers. Second-year LB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4243256/devin-lloyd\">Devin Lloyd</a> has taken a major step forward, and LB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050073/foyesade-oluokun\">Foyesade Oluokun</a> is second in the league in tackles (92). The offense has had its moments but hasn't consistently functioned on a high level, due in part to injuries along the line and to WR <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3059722/zay-jones\">Zay Jones</a> (knee). However, QB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has posted a career-best five consecutive games with a passer rating over 90, and RB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239996/travis-etienne-jr\">Travis Etienne Jr</a>. is third in the NFL in rushing (583 yards) and fourth in yards from scrimmage (839). There's a feeling in the building that the offense will eventually come together the way it did at the end of last season, and then the Jaguars could be tough to handle.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>Why they're vulnerable</b>: The pass rush is an issue. The Jaguars rank 26th in QB pressure percentage (32.4%), and their 16 sacks are the third fewest in the league. Allen is having the best season of his career (9 sacks) but the rest of the team has combined for just seven. LB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426349/travon-walker\">Travon Walker</a>, the No. 1 overall pick in 2022, has 3.5, which ties his rookie total, but nobody else has more than two sacks. The Jaguars have been able to overcome that with the turnovers, but it's hard to count on them producing those at the same pace they have in the first eight games. Another issue is the offensive lulls in the second half: 42.9% of their drives result in no first downs, which ranks 29th. The Jaguars have made clutch plays when needed -- WR <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk</a>'s 44-yard TD catch against New Orleans and Etienne's 56-yard TD catch against Pittsburgh, for example -- so that has helped, but the offense has yet to consistently function at the high level the team expected. <i>-- DiRocco</i></p>\n<p><b>ESPN BET:</b> The Jaguars are +900 to win the AFC and +1800 to win the Super Bowl.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>Ravens</h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Why the Ravens have a legitimate shot at the top seed:</b> The Ravens have proved they can soundly beat anyone when they're at their best. Case in point: a 39-6 rout of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a> two weeks ago. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> has shown flashes of his 2019 NFL MVP form with his efficient passing and elusive scrambling. He has completed a career-best 70.5% of his throws and has produced 16 runs of 10 yards or more, which is tied for most in the league. The strength of this team has been the defense, which has proved to be championship-caliber since the acquisition of Pro Bowl middle linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915189/roquan-smith\">Roquan Smith</a> a year ago. Baltimore leads the league in fewest points allowed at 15.1 per game, as well as sacks with 31. The Ravens have a big advantage in the schedule with only three road games remaining. Jackson is 15-2 (.882) when playing at home in November, December and January.</p>\n<p><b>Why they're vulnerable</b>: The obvious reason is Jackson's track record in terms of health. He has not finished the past two seasons, and the Ravens are 2-7 without him in December and January. Last season, Baltimore's offense sputtered in Jackson's absence, averaging 13 points. The other concern is the consistency of the offense in the first season under new coordinator Todd Monken. The Ravens rank 29th in the NFL in total yards in the second half (134.9) and have scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter (only three teams have fewer). Baltimore lacks an explosive running back since the season-ending Achilles injury to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241985/jk-dobbins\">J.K. Dobbins</a>, and it doesn't have a legitimate No. 3 option in the passing game after wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429615/zay-flowers\">Zay Flowers</a> and tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews\">Mark Andrews</a>. This is why the Ravens need Jackson at full strength if they want to earn the second No. 1 seed in franchise history. <i>-- Hensley</i></p>\n<p><b>ESPN BET:</b> The Ravens are +650 to win the AFC and +1300 to win the Super Bowl.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Brown is \"uncoverable\" at the moment and is on the list of people who don't have to leave the pool when they blow the whistle for adult swim.

Levis had four touchdowns in his debut, unlocking the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins\">DeAndre Hopkins</a> cheat code (it also marked the receiver's first touchdown with Tennessee). On a day when 13 backup QBs played (and six started and looked a mess), Levis looked like the guy whose potential had him being discussed as a first-rounder.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> are 4-3.

He worked all three levels of the field in this one, set up coverage at the top of the route and showcased his catch-and-run traits. Prescott was dialed in here, too, completing 80% of his throws versus the Rams, finishing with 304 yards passing and four touchdowns.

He'll get a chance to rebound in the matchup versus the Bucs' defense. <i>-- Bowen</i></p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/car.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"><strong>4. <b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045163/miles-sanders\">Miles Sanders</a>, RB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers</a></b></strong></strong></p>\n<p>He has clearly lost his grip on the starting role, as he played only 12 offensive snaps, had two carries and did nothing with them (0.0 PPR fantasy points).

After a frustrating game at San Francisco, he has followed it up with back to back 100-yard games. That's what they need. Lamb said getting him involved early not only helps him but helps the entire offense because defenses will have to alter how they cover him. It's hard to expect 12 catches for 158 yards and two scores each week, but if Lamb can stay on course, the offense seems to follow him. \"Honestly, just getting in the game early gets the defense on their heels and gives them a reason to focus on me,\" Lamb said. \"(After that) I want all my guys to explode.\" --<em> Todd Archer</em></p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/no.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\">Is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054850/alvin-kamara\">Alvin Kamara</a> <em>really</em> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>'s No. 1 target in the pass game?</strong></p>\n<p>Kamara has equaled <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361370/chris-olave\">Chris Olave</a> with 44 overall targets despite playing in three fewer games, but he was actually third in targets behind Olave and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas\">Michael Thomas</a> against the Colts.

Hopkins was targeted six times in Levis' debut and came down with four receptions for 128 yards and three touchdowns. It's safe to say that Hopkins will continue to be Levis' primary pass catcher because good things happen when the ball goes his way. Levis said Hopkins is the type of wide receiver that's open even when he's covered. That's a sign of immense trust in Hopkins who Levis connected with for three touchdowns. Hopkins has a Dennis Rodman-like ability to always get into position to get the ball. He's also capable of getting yards after the catch.

  "<p><video1>On an overcast 87-degree September evening in 2015 at Arrowhead Stadium, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> did what they have done for decades in a rivalry that dates back to the AFL's earliest days -- they slugged it out.</p>\n<p>In the game's closing seconds, Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall knocked the ball free from Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16719/bradley-roby\">Bradley Roby</a> recovered and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos -- who would go on to win Super Bowl 50 five months later -- had pulled off an improbable 31-24 win for their 15th consecutive AFC West road victory.</p>\n<p>But the current Broncos-Chiefs rivalry, or what's left of it, has not reflected that era for several seasons.</p>\n<p>The Broncos are 0-16 against the Chiefs since that night and Sunday (4:25 p.m. ET, CBS) is their next chance to break the streak. A cavalcade of coaches, quarterbacks and losing seasons have followed, and no losing streak signifies Denver's troubles more than the one led by Chiefs 28-year-old wunderkind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, who is 12-0 against Denver.</p>\n<p>Broncos coach Sean Payton got his first glimpse of it two weeks ago in Kansas City. There have been routs, big plays and small ones, close calls and last-second kicks, just no Broncos win.</p>\n<p>\"Just hard to believe,'' former Broncos cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14398/chris-harris-jr\">Chris Harris Jr</a>. said. \"That's a long, long time.''</p>\n<p>Or as former Chief, and now former Bronco, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576242/frank-clark\">Frank Clark</a> put it in training camp: \"In a rivalry, it's competitive, true or false? Until (the Broncos) become competitive enough, we have to beat the team.''</p>\n<p>Things continue inching perilously close to the 20-game losing streak the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> had to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> from 1970-79, the longest in the NFL's post AFL-NFL merger era.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>These six games encapsulate some of the toughest moments of the losing streak:</p>\n<h2>Loss No. 1: Nov. 15, 2015, Chiefs 29, Broncos 13</h2>\n<p>This one started it all. It also revealed the severity of quarterback Peyton Manning's foot injury, which he later would disclose was a partial tear of his plantar fascia. He went on to miss seven starts.</p>\n<p>Manning was 5-of-20 passing for 35 yards with four interceptions when coach Gary Kubiak pulled him with 6:34 left in the third quarter. The game included one of the most uncomfortable game stoppages in memory as Manning had been honored after his first completion moved him past Brett Favre as the league's all-time passing yardage leader. Manning already had an interception and had lost a fumble in the game before the 4-yard completion to Ronnie Hillman broke the record.</p>\n<p>\"I was protecting him because I was worried about him,'' Kubiak said then of pulling Manning. \"I am disappointed in myself, this one is on me. I should have probably made the decision not to play him.''</p>\n<p>The Chiefs led 29-0 early in the fourth quarter. The Super Bowl 50 win, in Manning's final game, would come in February, but hidden somewhere in the confetti was the first domino of the ongoing streak.</p>\n<h2>Loss No. 3: Dec. 25, 2016, Chiefs 33, Broncos 10</h2>\n<p>Nothing signals doom quite like a nose tackle throwing a touchdown pass.</p>\n<p>Chiefs coach Andy Reid dialed up the play for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14939/dontari-poe\">Dontari Poe</a>, listed at 346 pounds, as the final score in a never-in-doubt rout.</p>\n<p>Poe, who had been used as a short-yardage blocker/runner in goal-line situations, took a direct snap, took a few steps toward the line of scrimmage, jumped and tossed a 2-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16318/demetrius-harris\">Demetrius Harris</a>.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>\"I've learned this over time, You can't score enough points against these teams,'' Reid said after the game. \"We don't take anything for granted. We're going to score as much as we can do it.''</p>\n<p>At the time, Poe was the first defensive player to throw a touchdown pass in a game since 1981.</p>\n<p>\"I would have saved it for another game, if I was them,'' Harris said then. \"They might need it more later, and now it's out. I mean, you don't like that stuff, but we've won the AFC West every year, man. It's their first chance to actually win it -- about time somebody beat us.''</p>\n<h2>Loss No. 5: Dec. 31, 2017, Chiefs 27, Broncos 24</h2>\n<p>Snow flurries swirled for the season finale as the Broncos closed out their second consecutive playoff miss with a 5-11 finish.</p>\n<p>But this day would be its own red-letter affair for the Broncos as Reid gave a then-22-year-old rookie named Mahomes his first career start.</p>\n<p>The quarterback went 22-of-35 passing for 284 yards with an interception. But he also put together his first game-winning drive, taking the Chiefs from their own 21-yard line with 2:45 to play into position for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3055899/harrison-butker\">Harrison Butker</a>'s 30-yard game winner on the final play.</p>\n<p>Mahomes was sacked on the first play of the drive, but then went 4-of-5 for 52 yards with a 4-yard run thrown in during the 11-play affair.</p>\n<p>Broncos cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11254/aqib-talib\">Aqib Talib</a>'s words have been true ever since: \"He's going to be a problem, you can see it, he ain't afraid.\"</p>\n<h2>Loss No. 8: Oct. 17, 2019, Chiefs 30, Broncos 6</h2>\n<p>Mahomes was 10-of-11 passing with a touchdown when, on a fourth-and-1 from the Broncos 5-yard line with 10 minutes left in the first half, Mahomes tried a sneak. He gained two yards, but suffered a dislocated kneecap.</p>\n<p>\"Not too many people get hurt on a sneak ... it's a freak thing,'' Reid said that night.</p>\n<p>Enter Matt Moore, who had played in all of 14 games in the previous four seasons combined. He promptly went 10-of-19 passing the rest of the way for 117 yards including a 57-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>.</p>\n<p>Broncos quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco</a>, signed that year with the idea he might repair the Broncos' woes at the position, was sacked eight times.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<h2>Loss No. 9: Dec. 15, 2019, Chiefs 23, Broncos 3</h2>\n<p>This one simply broke the unbreakable.</p>\n<p>Nobody in and around the Broncos routinely exuded optimism more than linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller\">Von Miller</a>. Miller was rarely without a smile and hardly ever missed a practice drill, let alone a practice, in his time with the Broncos.</p>\n<p>But after this rather routine dispatching of the Broncos that included a 340-yard, two-touchdown day from Mahomes and helped the Chiefs clinch their fourth consecutive division title, a dispirited Miller looked like a player who believed it might not get better.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know how we got to this point,'' a grim Miller said after the game. \" ... It just defeats my soul to go out there and play the way we play and lose the way we lose ... I'm ready to bring whatever we had in the past back. I want that back.''</p>\n<h2>Loss No. 15, Jan. 1, 2023, Chiefs 27, Broncos 24</h2>\n<p>Jerry Rosburg, an interim coach who had been hired early last season as a consultant on clock- and game-management issues, almost snapped the streak to close out last season as the replacement for the fired Nathaniel Hackett.</p>\n<p>Denver, who had a confounding offensive pass interference flag thrown on wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128429/courtland-sutton\">Courtland Sutton</a> early on after he had fought through double coverage for a 44-yard catch that was waved off, had a 17-13 lead with under seven minutes to go in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>But alas, the Chiefs scored 14 fourth-quarter points, and the Broncos, trailing 27-24 with 1:21 to play, failed to convert a fourth-and-2 from their own 45-yard line as quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a> was sacked for the league-leading 53rd time that season.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>\"I'm heartbroken for (the players) ... it wasn't good enough, I'm heartbroken for them, they deserve a win,'' Rosburg said. \"This whole streak thing ... that I think is just fantasy, has got to stop and the only way it's going to stop is if we stop making errors down the stretch in the game. (But) they fought until the very end.''</p>\n<h2>Can Payton put an end to the losses?</h2>\n<p>There are times when Payton, seven games into his Denver tenure, has bristled at discourse over past success or current streaks. On Sunday, after the Broncos' victory over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Green Bay Packers</a>, he was quick to swat away a question about how Denver let 10 consecutive halftime leads get away up until the Week 7 win.</p>\n<p>\"Who? My team hasn't blown 10 straight. You said, 'Your team'.

  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>Another NFL Sunday is in the books, and the exclamation point at the end of the sentence was the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>' dominant win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> in a matchup of 5-1 teams.</p>\n<p>But starting with the beginning of the day, a week after failing to score a touchdown on five of six red zone trips, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> flipped the script in Week 7 against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a>. The Ravens became the fifth team this season to score five red zone TDs. Detroit entered Sunday with the NFL's best defense, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> was brilliant and after hearing about it all summer, is <em>this</em> is the kind of game that shows you what they can be offensively?</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> are 4-3 and they're lucky they aren't 3-4 after the end of that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants</a> game last week. They have a four-game stretch later in the season: at Philadelphia, at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, home for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a> and at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>. I'm not writing an obit here, because we saw the ceiling in that blowout of Miami, but they're making this an uphill climb and they've got a short turnaround Thursday night against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> this week.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a> enjoyed this one for a lot of reasons -- the 300th win for Bill Belichick chief among them. How many more wins remain for Bill with the Patriots is hard to know, but their time together has been legendary.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seattle Seahawks</a>' defense is nasty, and the team keeps identifying young talent it can plug and play immediately. Two home run drafts in a row, apparently. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4575431/devon-witherspoon\">Devon Witherspoon</a> is the latest. He's not a big dude, but his impact is felt in a big way... his nine pass breakups this season are tied for third most in the NFL and he has played only five games.</p>\n<p>I feel badly for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a> and Chargers -- they never have home games. Dallas came in and took over SoFi Stadium last Monday against the Chargers and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> did it Sunday against the Rams. Yes, those are two of the biggest traveling fan bases in the NFL, but the Rams and Chargers are a combined 2-5 at home this season and 3-3 on the road. My point is, they just <em>never</em> have a home-field advantage.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, I'm convinced <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> has it in perpetuity. Kansas City just keeps rolling along and I'm becoming convinced Mahomes will never play a road playoff game. He has played 14 postseason games with 11 at Arrowhead Stadium and three in the Super Bowl. That feels unfair, but not as unfair as Mahomes when he is scrambling. It feels almost unjust. I don't mean he is breaking rules -- I just mean it is third-and-15 and he scrambles for first downs. After Sunday, he has a pair of runs for a first down on third-and-15 or more this season -- the rest of the NFL has one.</p>\n<p>And since he became the Chiefs' starter in 2018, they have converted on 22% of their third-and-15s while the NFL average is just 9%. If I were playing against him I would want to pull my hair out -- and I'm in no position to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a> made his first catch for the Kansas City Chiefs in the last two games a big one. Valdes-Scantling caught a 46-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> early in the second quarter to give the Chiefs a 10-3 lead over the Chargers. 1:59</p>\n<p>Valdes-Scantling is a starter but had just seven receptions this season coming into the Chargers game. He was held without a catch in last week's game against the Denver Broncos. But he scored his first touchdown of the season by getting open down field on a Mahomes scramble.</p>\n<p>Valdes-Scantling was 22 yards down field at the time of the catch.

  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> thought they were set at wide receiver heading into the season by bringing back four players who contributed to last year's Super Bowl winning team.</p>\n\n\n<p>It speaks to just how much this season has deviated from the plan that their leading player at the position is instead a rookie, second-round draft pick <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>They also this week traded for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035004/mecole-hardman-jr\">Mecole Hardman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38689014/jets-trade-wr-mecole-hardman-back-chiefs\" target=\"_blank\">bringing back</a> a player who caught 151 passes and scored 19 touchdowns in four seasons for the Chiefs before leaving as a free agent earlier this year for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a>. The move suggests the Chiefs are looking to get more production from a receiving game that has featured a consistent threat in tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> and hope for bigger things from Rice.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"This isn't necessarily the type of offense where you're going to see one guy who has 18 targets every week,\" offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said. \"That's just not us and it's always kind of been that way. Over time there have been some outliers here or there, but I think that's the beauty of the offense, too.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We have a lot of guys that are learning to play wide receiver within this offense, and we're learning who they are. It's just a little bit of both, and then just continuing to grow so that when we get to the end of the season, we're rolling.\"</p>\n<inline1>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs have a lot of room for that growth. Their wide receivers have caught 70 passes, the same total as last season through six games.</p>\n\n\n<p>But the yards-per-catch average is far down from last season, when the Chiefs were eighth in the league among wide receivers at 13.9. This year, the wide receivers are 18th at 12.2 yards.</p>\n\n\n<p>Most of their veteran wide-outs have yet to produce as the Chiefs hoped. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a> have combined for just 35 catches, 353 yards and two touchdowns.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I still feel like at times when it's most needed, guys are making the plays,\" quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> said, pointing to big catches by Moore and Rice late in last week's game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"As we continue in the season, we have to continue to get better and better so that hopefully when we get to the playoffs, we're hitting our stride and we can really match our defense in regards of intensity.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p>Even though he practiced with the Chiefs for the first time on Thursday, Hardman could play in Sunday's game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> at Arrowhead Stadium. His most productive season with the Chiefs came as a rookie in 2019, when he scored seven touchdowns, including one on a kickoff return, and had a per-catch average of 20.7 yards.</p>\n\n\n<p>But he was playing well last year, with 17 catches for 226 yards and four touchdowns in his final four games of the regular season before he tore his groin so badly he said he couldn't move his legs for a time and spent 10 days in the hospital.</p>\n\n\n<p>Hardman said he's at 100% now and the Chiefs might utilize him in much the same role as they had. The Chiefs tried to take advantage of his speed by getting him the ball on jet sweeps, screens and pop passes.</p>\n<p>\"He's done that and I think he's good at it,\" Nagy said. \"But we just have to decide, 'Is that something that we want to do as we grow here and do we want to add more things to that? When we didn't have him up until now this past year or offseason, what are some things that maybe we wish we did do with him now that we don't have him?' So we'll work through all that, but he's good at all that. He has that element of speed.\"</p>\n<p>Rice has already taken on a bigger role than the Chiefs anticipated for him, at least early in the season. He hasn't been perfect, dropping a couple of passes for a drop percentage of 7.1%. But he still trails only Kelce on the Chiefs in catches (21) and receptions (245).</p>\n\n\n<p>\"In practice we started with that fast pace, so during the preseason it got me ready, got my nerves out of the way, got me out of the way in being in a rush instead of just being calm and playing fast, so when the regular season got here, I was just ready for my moment,\" Rice said.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We just have a great quarterback who can get out of the pocket and he can always do something amazing when the ball is in his hands. So if you're available and you're in his eyesight all you have to do is watch the ball and make the play.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs have tried to get the ball to Rice when he can run after the catch. His average of almost seven yards after the catch is fifth in the NFL among wide receivers.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I think it's a huge part [of my game],\" Rice said. \"I feel like every time I get the ball in my hands the minimum I'm going to get is five yards. I feel like any kind of screen or anything you get, any run of four yards or more is a great [gain] to get the offensive game started.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>With the Chiefs getting little from many of their other wide receivers, Rice's play has become vital to the Chiefs. The Chiefs have 11 games left in the regular season, so there's plenty of time for one or more of their other wide receivers to catch him statistically.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nagy said he wouldn't be surprised if Rice doesn't lead the wide-outs when the season is finished.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so, no,\" Nagy said. \"I know week to week it could be somebody that jumps up and has a great game. And so these guys know that in our walkthrough, when we're in practice, it's like, 'Who's going to get it this week?'</p>\n<p>\"I think that's what the strength of this offense can be.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Late in Super Bowl LIV, Mahomes was scrambling on a 4th-and-9 with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> down 22 points.

They are ninth in scoring at 24.5 points per game and seventh in yards at 382 yards per game.</p>\n<p>However, that is below the standards they have set since Mahomes became their starter in 2018. To win games, they have had to rely on their defense, which against the Broncos held an opponent to 10 points or fewer for the third time this season and took a shutout into the fourth quarter for the second time.</p>\n<p>\"Luckily for us, our defense is playing great so we can go through these growing pains and try to get better and better,\" Mahomes said. \"The talent is there. You can see it in spurts.</p>\n<p>\"I thought we did a great job of staying patient, getting the ball down the field, but in this league, three points and seven points is just such a big difference, and so I think if we found a way to execute in the red zone and score those touchdowns, we'd come away feeling great. Since we didn't, we have a lot of room to improve, and so that's just something that we've got to continue to work on. It's just putting a full game together. Let's put a full game together and see what we can do.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes said the Chiefs usually build their offensive identity as the season goes on, but the process is taking longer this season. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a>, with nine catches against the Broncos, is again a consistent receiving threat, and running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361529/isiah-pacheco\">Isiah Pacheco</a> is averaging 4.4 yards per carry.</p>\n<p>But the Chiefs are struggling to find wide receivers they can count on. The most reliable has been a rookie, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a>, who has 21 catches and a pair of touchdowns. He is their only wide receiver with at least 12 receptions and an average of more than 10 yards per catch.</p>\n<p>\"We're getting more [deep] coverage than even I expected,\" Mahomes said. \"There's a lot of deep coverages, and it's forced us to be patient, drive the length of the field.</p>\n<p>\"... We did a good job driving the field. We just didn't score the touchdowns today. So the defenses are going to do that. We'll continue to get better and better at it, and then when the opportunity arises and we get man coverage, we have to make sure we hit those deep ones.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p><strong>AS THE FOURTH</strong> quarter of Super Bowl LVII neared 11 minutes, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> fielded a punt at his own 37-yard line while the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> held a 28-27 lead over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. Toney was surrounded by seven Eagles and had seemingly no way out of trouble.</p>\n\n\n<p>After taking a hit, Toney regained his balance and found one. He reversed field and eventually made his way down the opposite sideline to complete the Super Bowl-record 65-yard punt return that set up the Chiefs for their final touchdown of the game.</p>\n\n\n<p>The play made apparent the talent the Chiefs saw in Toney when they <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34890307/chiefs-trade-picks-giants-wr-kadarius-toney-source-says\" target=\"_blank\">traded for him</a> ahead of last year's deadline. But this season has so far highlighted why the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants</a> were so willing to trade Toney in the first place.</p>\n\n\n<p>Toney tore his meniscus during a kick return drill moments before the Chiefs were to begin their first training camp practice. He had surgery and made it back for the season's first game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a>, and his play was the story of the game: He dropped several passes, including one he deflected to a defender who returned it for a touchdown in a game the Chiefs lost by one point.</p>\n\n\n<p>Almost a year after dealing for him, the Chiefs are no closer than the Giants were to solving the riddle of Toney. Is he the game-breaker who delivered the big play and scored a fourth-quarter touchdown in the Super Bowl or the injury-prone player who is liable for the 1-yard game he had against Detroit?</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's not maybe your every-down wide receiver with pure fundamentals,\" said Dan Mullen, who coached Toney at Florida. \"I don't know that he's going to ever be a No. 1 receiver. That's not his style of play. But he can be that guy in the return game and the screen game and all of these other things you can do with him.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"You get him the ball and you can see what happens. He's a weapon you'd love to have on your team, and there's nobody better than Andy in finding different ways to isolate people and getting them the ball and utilize their talents.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>THE CHIEFS HAD</strong> chased Toney for a year and a half before finally finishing the job last year. They hoped to maneuver into position to draft him in 2021 but failed when the Giants picked him in the first round. They tried trading for him in spring 2022 but couldn't come to an agreement then with the Giants.</p>\n\n\n<p>All along, it was clear the Chiefs thought a lot of Toney. He caught 70 passes in his final season at Florida, ran a scorching 4.39 40-yard dash at his pro day and had an unusual ability to change direction in the open field and make defenders miss, as he showed on his Super Bowl punt return.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's really good,\" Chiefs general manager Brett Veach said. \"He can do anything. He's predominately been a guy that is a slot receiver, returner, runner, gadget guy if you will, but I don't know if there is a limit on his game because he has a vertical game.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He was a first-round pick for a reason. There's a reason why we traded for him.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>After losing two of last season's top wide receivers, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035004/mecole-hardman-jr\">Mecole Hardman</a>, in free agency, Toney seemed this year to be in a perfect spot to become Mahomes' new favorite target.</p>\n\n\n<p>Through five games, Toney has 14 catches for 83 yards, averaging 5.9 yards per catch. He has not found the end zone. He is eighth on the team in receiving yards, behind running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361529/isiah-pacheco\">Isiah Pacheco</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I told coach, I told Pat, I told all the guys, 'That's on me,'\" Toney said. \"At the end of the day, you all count on me and rely on me to make certain plays and I've got to be there to do that.'</p>\n<p>\"There [isn't] really [any] excuse.\"</p>\n<photo3>\n\n\n<p><strong>TONEY'S STINT WITH</strong> the Giants was doomed from the day he first set foot in the building in spring 2021. He pulled himself out of his first rookie minicamp practice to adjust his shoe and did not return.</p>\n\n\n<p>One team source later told ESPN that Toney's cleats were the wrong size and had caused discomfort because they were too tight. The source said Toney started to wear socks once he arrived in the NFL, something he hadn't done in college, and they did not fit inside his cleats. And that was just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n<p>Toney didn't show up to voluntary OTAs while he and the Giants worked out his rookie contract. Then came the hamstring, ankle, quad, oblique and knee injuries. Toney also had a pair of bouts with COVID-19. By the time all was said and done, he had missed 12 of a possible 24 games with the Giants through a season and a half.</p>\n\n\n<p>Toney constantly objected to the idea that he was unhappy about playing time or that he was injury prone, despite vague social media posts that suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p>In his most productive game in a Big Blue uniform (vs. Dallas on Oct. 10, 2021) he didn't make it to the finish line. Toney was ejected for throwing a punch in the fourth quarter after hauling in 10 catches on 13 targets for 189 yards while making defenders look silly trying to tackle him.</p>\n<p>With all this on his résumé, general manager Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll decided Toney didn't fit the culture they were trying to build in their first season in New York.</p>\n<alsosee>\n<p>Toney was drafted by the previous GM and coach, Dave Gettleman and Joe Judge. One former Giants assistant thought Toney could blossom into the \"best receiver in the league.\"</p>\n<p>It never happened in New York. Schoen traded Toney prior to the deadline because he knew Toney's value could continue to diminish below the third- and sixth-round picks the Giants received from the Chiefs, especially if he missed more games because of injury (which he eventually did).</p>\n<p>The Giants had lost trust in Toney. It dated back to the arrival of the new leadership in the 2022 offseason, when they didn't know what the talented wide receiver was doing in regards to his training/rehab in the offseason. By the time the draft came around several months later, other teams were under the impression that Toney's services could be had for the right price, even though Schoen insisted he never \"shopped\" the talented receiver.</p>\n<p>When Toney joined the Giants in spring 2022, he hurt his knee on the first day of offseason workouts and needed to have a procedure. He again spent the rest of the spring and most of the summer on the sideline</p>\n\n\n<p>Toney was active in Weeks 1 and 2, logging two catches for 0 yards, but reinjured his hamstring in the Week 2 win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers</a> and that sidelined him for Weeks 3 and 4.</p>\n\n\n<p>Toney then injured his left hamstring in practice ahead of Week 5, saying the injury to his left hamstring was likely a result of trying to return too quickly from the previous injuries to his right hamstring.</p>\n<p>Schoen and the Giants weren't sure Toney would stay for treatment through the Giants' Week 9 bye. So they jumped at the Chiefs' offer, which came several weeks before the actual trade deadline.</p>\n<p>The Giants used the third-round pick to trade for tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576925/darren-waller\">Darren Waller</a>. The sixth-round selection turned into cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4686553/tre-hawkins\">Tre Hawkins III</a>, who was the surprise of Giants training camp and has appeared in four games this season.</p>\n<photo1>\n\n\n<p><strong>IT'S NOT TOO</strong> late for Toney to become the player the Chiefs long envisioned. The Chiefs have seven wide receivers, but none has played consistently well this season. Tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> is the team's leading receiver.</p>\n\n\n<p>In any case, the Chiefs have no receiver quite like Toney.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He brings energy,\" Kelce said. \"I think his ability speaks for itself. He's very quick, can put his foot in the ground with the best of them. And he's special with the ball in his hands. He's one of those guys where his awareness is crazy. You think he's got eyes in the back of his head because he sees guys coming from different angles and stuff.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's electric. ... He was that piece for us in the Super Bowl and he was that piece for us through the year last year.\"</p>\n<inline1>\n<p>Toney has been with Mahomes for almost a full season. But they've rarely had dedicated practice time together. Training camp is the best time for that. Toney was in camp with the Giants last year and didn't practice at camp this year after having the meniscus surgery.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs are hopeful that playing with a quarterback like Mahomes can expand Toney's game.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I don't know if [the Giants] were a team that really vertically pushed the ball down the field,\" Veach said. \"It's a fair question to [ask]: Has he ever played with a quarterback that likes to push the ball down the field?</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We have a lot of high hopes for him. I think the sky is the limit for him.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The trade to the Chiefs, at least initially, seemed to energize Toney. He said shortly after joining the Chiefs that he already felt more a part of things in Kansas City than he ever did with the Giants. Mullen said the switch in teams was a much-needed fresh start for Toney.</p>\n\n\n<p>But eventually, he's going to have to produce.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's an outside-the-box player,\" Mullen said. \"But he's playing for an outside-the-box coach and with an outside-the-box quarterback and an outside-the-box organization that allows him to have some freedom and have some fun.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's got a unique set of skills. He's like Liam Neeson in \"Taken.\" He's got a special set of skills that make him very dangerous, but it's only if he's in the hands of the right person.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> on Thursday took the blame for a lack of production from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>' wide receivers and problems with the team's passing game.</p>\n<p>\"If I start playing better, everybody will start playing better,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Mahomes threw two interceptions in Sunday night's game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a>. The Chiefs, after taking an early 17-0 lead, had to hang on for a 23-20 victory.</p>\n<p>\"I missed some opportunities throughout the game, and so I've just got to put us in better positions and [start] making better decisions so that the guys can go out there and work for me and make plays down the field.''</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Mahomes, last season's NFL MVP, is 10th in yards (1,006), 21st in completion percentage (64.3%) and tied for second in interceptions (4) this season.</p>\n<p>He said the interceptions against the Jets were the result of him being \"greedy.''</p>\n<p>\"It's something that I have to continue to get better and better throughout my career,'' Mahomes said. \"Sometimes when stuff's maybe not going as well or if I want to get that deep shot going, I'll try to force it, whereas there are just times where I've got to just throw the ball away or take the checkdown and it goes against my nature. But it's something that you have to do at this quarterback position in order to have success.</p>\n<p>\"You want to attack down the field. It makes defenses have to account for that. You never want to be stuck throwing the checkdowns underneath every single time because that's when you can really condense the offense. We take pride of being able to stretch it vertically and horizontally. That'll be something that I'll manage throughout my career.''</p>\n<p>The Chiefs haven't been getting consistent production from their wide receivers in particular. Chiefs wideouts are tied for 25th in catches (45), 18th in yards (588), tied for 19th in touchdowns (2) and 32nd in drop rate (8.1%).</p>\n<p>Rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a>, with 13 catches, is the only Chiefs wide receiver with double-digit receptions. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a>, expected before the season to be among the team's receiving leaders, have combined for 16 catches and 169 yards.</p>\n<p>\"We have a couple of young guys that we're kind of bringing along,'' coach Andy Reid said of the wide receivers. \"But I think they're doing a pretty good job.''</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> had answers for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> the passer Sunday night after he threw his only touchdown of the game, a 34-yarder to tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240472/noah-gray\">Noah Gray</a>, in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The Jets couldn't solve Mahomes as a runner, which is why the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> escaped MetLife Stadium with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401547455\" target=\"_blank\">23-20 victory</a>.</p>\n<p>Mahomes rushed for 51 yards -- including 32 on the game's final drive, which saw the Chiefs kill the last 7½ minutes of game clock. His 25-yard run on third-and-23 was the big play of the drive. He also had a 9-yard run on third-and-8 with 2 minutes remaining and could have scored, but he went down intentionally at the Jets' 2-yard line so the Chiefs could maintain possession and run out the clock.</p>\n<p>Mahomes has had bigger rushing games for the Chiefs but perhaps none as impactful. His late-game scrambling helped make up for his two first-half interceptions, which helped the Jets pull into a tie after an early 17-0 deficit.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>That's why Mahomes was particularly fired up after his 25-yard run. He got up pumping his fist in celebration.</p>\n<p>\"We needed that play in that time,'' Mahomes said. \"We were trying to do what we can to keep the defense off the field. They'd been playing their tail off in that second half.</p>\n<p>\"I'm a little upset. I kind of stumbled. I was thinking I could maybe get around the side a little bit, but it was a big first down and then we were able to kind of keep it moving down the field.''</p>\n<p>Mahomes will never be confused as a runner with, say, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a>' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>. But he joked that he doesn't get enough respect for that part of his game.</p>\n<p>\"I've told a lot of people I'm faster than people think,'' Mahomes said. \"I don't run pretty, so people think I'm slow, but I move a little bit better than people think.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe one day I'll get a spy. That's my goal. If I get a spy, I'll know I made it.''</p>\n<p>Mahomes has two career 50-plus-yard rushing games against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>. Linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3129310/drue-tranquill\">Drue Tranquill</a>, in his first season with the Chiefs after four with the Chargers, overheard Mahomes' request for a defensive spy and said, \"We didn't spy him for four years and we paid the price.''</p>\n<p>Later, Tranquill said, \"That's why [Mahomes] is the greatest in the world. Even on a night when he throws two or three picks, whatever it was, for him to be able to convert on third-and-20 with his legs, for him to be able to convert on third-and-8 down there to close out the game ... it speaks to the toughness and the grit of the entire offensive personnel and then the belief this organization has in [Mahomes] to get the job done.''</p>\n<p>With his throw to Gray, Mahomes also became the fastest to 200 NFL touchdown passes, reaching the milestone in his 84th game to break Dan Marino's NFL record. Marino threw his 200th TD pass in his 89th NFL game with Miami in 1989.</p>\n<p>\"It means a ton -- the people that are on the list, the quarterbacks that came before me. You just got to keep going, the game has changed,\" Mahomes said. \"I think someone will pass me before too long, so you just got to go out there and keep playing.</p>\n<p>\"The one thing that doesn't change is Super Bowls, so I'm going to try to keep getting those.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> became the fastest NFL quarterback to reach 25,000 career passing yards, and he got there on Sunday in a fitting manner.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a> signal-caller went over the milestone on one of his longest passes of the day, a 37-yard throw to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling\">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a> in the third quarter of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547438\">41-10 win</a> over the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a> at Arrowhead Stadium.</p>\n<p>\"It really is cool,\" Mahomes said. \"Doing it at Arrowhead ... it's a tremendous honor to be a part of this organization and be able to do stuff like that at this stadium.

Mahomes for a couple of moments late in the first half appeared he might not get to the milestone on Sunday. He had an ankle rolled on by Bears defensive lineman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3053044/yannick-ngakoue\">Yannick Ngakoue</a> and briefly was hobbled by the injury.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Mahomes stayed in the game until finishing his only drive of the second half with a 3-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a>. That play put the Chiefs ahead 41-0, and Mahomes said he didn't exit the game because of the injury. He suffered a high ankle sprain in last year's divisional round playoff win over the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, though he played in the AFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>\"I would've been fine to play the rest of the game,\" he said. \"If anything, it kind of scared me more just being that ankle.</p>\n<p>\"We taped it up and then I was able to go.\"</p>\n<p>The Chiefs for the first time this season resembled the team that led the NFL in scoring last year. They had 312 yards in the first half and led 34-0.</p>\n<p>Mahomes finished 24-of-33 passing for 272 yards and three touchdowns.</p>\n<p>\"It always feels good to get the whole offense going,\" he said. \"The first two weeks, we just have been out of rhythm. We haven't got drives and sustained drives going, and so just to not have those killer penalties and to get the offense moving in the right direction, then all the other stuff kind of comes with it. So I was proud of the guys today. Still little things here and there we can tweak, but it was a step in the right direction.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes defended offensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034961/jawaan-taylor\">Jawaan Taylor</a>, who was called twice for lining up off the line of scrimmage. The Bears declined one of the penalties, but the other cost the Chiefs a long touchdown pass.</p>\n<p>Taylor was penalized five times in last week's game against the Jaguars.</p>\n<p>\"It's wild to me,\" Mahomes said. \"When you go back and look [at the penalty calls] and both [Chiefs' tackles] are in the exact same spot, I don't understand it. It's hard because he's playing great football and he's getting these penalties thrown on him, and I know it's hard to officiate. But I watch a lot of tape, and he's no deeper than any other tackle in the league.</p>\n<p>\"There are other guys that are even further back than he is, so it's crazy to see, and hopefully it kind of calms down as the season goes on. He's making adjustments, and it seems like even with his adjustments they're not good enough.\"</p>\n<p>The Chiefs briefly removed Taylor from the game, as they did against the Jaguars. But coach Andy Reid said this time it was because of injury. He said Taylor had been hit in the mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

You get that security -- and I already had it -- but just to get a little bump and then be able to go back out there and just play football, I'm excited for it.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Mahomes said he felt a responsibility to the NFL's other top quarterbacks to continue to raise the salary bar after recent deals by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>.</p>\n<p>\"You've got to keep the bar going; you got to keep it moving,\" Mahomes said. \"I don't want people to be negotiated against me, and so that's the reason that you do something like I did this last week ... just trying to keep the market moving in the right direction, training in the right direction, so not only me but other quarterbacks in other positions can get paid the money that they deserve.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes has said he will eventually be judged by how many games and championships he wins and not by how much money he is paid. He indicated this contract would allow him to do both.</p>\n<p>\"I always talk about not having regrets,\" Mahomes said. \"The money is the money. It's awesome. It's amazing. I know I can do a lot of great things not only for myself but for people that have given me so much. But at the end of the day, I'm going to be looked back on how I played the game, and I hope that that's with intensity and leaving everything out there, and hopefully that means winning a lot of football games.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

He will average $52.6 million over the next four seasons with his restructuring, putting him more in line with the recent quarterback deals. </p>\n<p>\"I don't know that there's really a way to quantify it financially, and no matter what he makes over his career, one way or another, he'll be underpaid,\" Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt said when asked how the Chiefs went about determining Mahomes' worth.</p>\n<p>Mahomes, 28, has been named NFL MVP twice and led the Chiefs to two Super Bowl victories -- being named the game's MVP both times -- in his first six seasons.

Four different times in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/schedule\">2023 offseason</a>, a quarterback signed a new contract that made him, by average annual salary, the highest-paid player in the NFL. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a> of the Eagles went first, followed by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> of the Ravens, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> of the Chargers and, finally, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> of the Bengals.

His salaries are currently guaranteed through 2025, and Mahomes makes $28.45 million this year, $37.95 million in 2024 and $38.9 million in 2025. The original extension was for 10 years, $450 million, and it was signed in July 2020 with two years left on his previous deal.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><strong>What's next:</strong> Mahomes' deal was always unique, built out longer than the current collective bargaining agreement runs and structured with rolling guarantees and roster bonuses to allow the Chiefs the salary cap space to sign other star players in the meantime and maximize their Super Bowl window. Since Mahomes signed the deal, the Chiefs have been to two of the three Super Bowls and won one of them. Kansas City has publicly acknowledged that Mahomes' deal <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/37722831/patrick-mahomes-priority-legacy-winning-rings-not-money\">will have to be adjusted</a> to reflect the fact that he's still the best quarterback in the league, even though six quarterbacks have signed deals since then that pay more than his $45 million per year.</p>\n<p><a name=\"tua\"></a></p>\n<p>The Chiefs have been busy <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38339651/chiefs-chris-jones-hopes-new-deal-says-play-opener\">trying</a> to get star defensive tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones\">Chris Jones</a> signed, but with that situation <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38380797/chiefs-dt-chris-jones-agree-new-1-year-contract\">settled</a>, look for the Chiefs to adjust Mahomes' deal to put his salary in line with the top of the market, which has moved significantly in the past three years. Because of the way it's structured, Mahomes' deal doesn't seem like it's ever going to be comparable to the other quarterback deals. Just feel confident that the Chiefs will take care of him and that he'll be willing to agree to structures that help them manage their cap.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/mia.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Current situation: </strong>Tagovailoa is signed through 2024 and will be making $4.738 million this year. And Miami exercised its fifth-year option on his rookie contract for $23.171 million for 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next: </strong>Tagovailoa threw for 466 yards in a season-opening win Sunday <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547401\">against the Chargers</a>, instantly validating the team's decision to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35829886/sources-dolphins-pick-5th-year-option-qb-tua-tagovailoa\">exercise the fifth-year option</a> despite the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/36235862/tua-tagovailoa-says-mulled-retiring-learned-how-fall\">health questions</a> that have hung over his career. This is one of the most fascinating situations in the entire league because of the number of different ways it can turn out.</p>\n<p>If Tagovailoa has a huge season in keeping with Week 1, the Dolphins will surely reward him next offseason with a contract that advances the market the way the Hurts, Jackson, Herbert and Burrow did this offseason. But if he struggles, or if he misses games again for health reasons, the Dolphins probably spend next offseason pondering an eventual replacement.</p>\n<p><a name=\"dak\"></a></p>\n<p>In other words, Tagovailoa could be out of a job in 2024 -- or he could be the new highest-paid player in NFL history as early as next March.

The Cowboys <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35829330/cowboys-rework-dak-prescott-zack-martin-deals-free-30m\">restructured</a> Prescott's deal in March, converting roughly $29 million of his $31 million 2023 salary into a signing bonus to save $20 million on this year's salary cap. He makes that $31 million this year and is scheduled to earn $34 million ($29 million salary and $5 million March roster bonus) in 2024. But after the 2024 season, his contract voids automatically, and it includes a clause that prohibits the Cowboys from using the franchise or transition tags on him. The original deal was for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31029457/dallas-cowboys-agree-new-contract-qb-dak-prescott\">four years, $160 million</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next: </strong>As of now, Prescott's 2024 cap number is $59.455 million -- which is massive and likely <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38267044/cowboys-jerry-jones-dak-prescott-talks-unaffected-lance-trade\">needs to be addressed</a>. The most likely way for the Cowboys to do so is with a new extension next offseason that would knock that number down and keep Prescott in their uniform for years to come.</p>\n<p>But when you remember how challenging these negotiations were last time, it's fair to wonder whether that's the only potential outcome.</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p>If we get to March and the Cowboys, for whatever reason, have decided they <em>don't </em>want to extend Prescott -- or if he has decided he'd rather play out the year than do another extension in Dallas -- then things get interesting.

The Cowboys could cut or trade him prior to paying the March roster bonus and save $34 million on their 2024 cap.</p>\n<p><a name=\"goff\"></a></p>\n<p>Obviously, they'd have to feel good about who they had to replace him, and regardless of the hype the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4383351/trey-lance\">Trey Lance</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38259989/qb-trey-lance-dealt-49ers-cowboys-4th-rounder\">trade</a> has generated, the Cowboys are a <em>long</em> way from being convinced the 2021 first-rounder or anyone else is a better long-term option than Prescott. The odds dramatically favor another Prescott extension that keeps him in Dallas long term. But because of the leverage the player has in this situation, it's worth keeping an eye on the possibility, however slim, that such an extension never materializes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/det.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Current situation:</strong> Goff is signed through 2024, earning $25.975 million this year.

The way he played last season, he's a steal on this deal.</p>\n<p>If the Lions, who started the 2023 season with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547353\">road victory</a> over the Super Bowl champion Chiefs, meet their lofty expectations this year, Goff could be in line for a big-money extension next offseason. He was the throw-in in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a> deal, as the Lions <em>had</em> to take him back to get the picks they wanted from the Rams in exchange for Stafford.

If he doesn't play well, the Packers can <em>easily</em> move on to other options.

For the first time since Cousins signed in Minnesota, the team actually has some flexibility to move on to another option without significant salary cap pain. Like Tannehill, Cousins could potentially find himself in free agency next offseason pitching himself as a competent solution for a team looking for a veteran QB.

The CBA dictates that Purdy's 2025 salary could rise because of proven performance escalators based on the number of offensive snaps he plays in his first three years, but that money still wouldn't be guaranteed, and by then -- if he's still playing well -- the Niners will be able to extend him.</p>\n<p><inline2-wide></p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> expected things to be bumpy at times in their season opener without injured tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> in their lineup. They didn't necessarily expect their offense to struggle as much as it did in their 21-20 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a>.</p>\n<p>\"It's going to have an impact on the game,\" quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> said of Kelce's absence. \"But other guys have to step up and they're going to have to step up in moments. Sure, there'll be times [after Kelce returns] that he gets doubled and so we're just going to have to rely on these other guys that are young and talented to step up and make plays, and I believe that they will.\"</p>\n<p>That didn't happen against the Lions. The Chiefs dropped numerous passes, none more damaging than the seemingly easy catch that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a> deflected to Lions safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4692025/brian-branch\">Brian Branch</a>, whose interception and return for a touchdown in the third quarter was the game's defining play.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The Chiefs were hopeful Toney could be their No. 1 wide receiver. But he missed all of training camp after having surgery for a torn meniscus and only recently returned to practice.</p>\n<p>He dropped two other passes and wound up with one catch for one yard.</p>\n<p>\"I have trust in [Toney],\" Mahomes said. \"He missed a lot of training camp, and obviously he wanted to play and fought [during] rehab hard so he could play and stuff's not always going to go your way.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously he would've wanted to catch a few of those in the game, but I've trusted he's going to be that guy that I go to in those crucial moments, and he's going to make the catch and win us some games like he did last year. So we're going to continue to work him in, get him more and more reps, and I'm sure that those drops will kind of disappear.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes was 10-of-22 (46%) throwing to wide receivers, his worst completion percentage to wideouts in 35 career games in which he has attempted at least 20 passes. The Chiefs' leading receiver was running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361529/isiah-pacheco\">Isiah Pacheco</a>, who had four catches.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs were hopeful Kelce, who hyperextended his knee in practice two days before the game, could have played. But coach Andy Reid indicated the decision to sit Kelce wasn't a difficult one.</p>\n<p>\"It just wasn't feeling right, so I wasn't going to put him out there with that,\" Reid said. \"And he was honest with me and we talked, so just not enough time there.\"</p>\n<p>A Week 2 game against the Jaguars in Jacksonville is next for the Chiefs. They will work to get Kelce ready for that game. Judging from the way they played against the Lions, they're going to need him.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not going to put anything past Trav,\" Mahomes said. \"He was trying to play today. He just literally couldn't. I don't even know if it was his decision. It was kind of the guys above him knowing it's going to be a long season.</p>\n<p>\"He's going to try. He'll do whatever he can to be out there, and hopefully he can clear all those doctors' tests and then get out there on the football field.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

In the past two decades, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a> (2007-11) and Chiefs are the only teams to have been preseason Super Bowl betting favorites in four of five years.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Kansas City's 6-1 odds this year are comparable to those in previous seasons, three of which ended in appearances at the Super Bowl, including a pair of comeback victories authored by Mahomes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (15-2), who lost to the Chiefs in last season's Super Bowl, have the second-best title odds at sportsbooks to begin the season. The Eagles, however, have the support of the betting public.

The Jets attracted bets throughout the offseason after opening at 40-1, and they remain one of the popular bets to win the Super Bowl. In fact, the Jets winning the Super Bowl would cost Caesars Sportsbook more money than any other team doing so.</p>\n<p>The largest Super Bowl bet so far this season at Caesars Sportsbook, though, came from an unidentified bettor in Nevada who placed a $20,000 wager on the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> to win the Super Bowl at 40-1 odds.

A DraftKings spokesperson told ESPN that the company received an $89 bet on a Texans-Cardinals Super Bowl at 10,000-1 odds.</p>\n<p>The 49ers are the largest division favorites, listed at -185 to win the NFC West. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> (-175, AFC South), Chiefs (-170, AFC West) and Eagles (-140, NFC East) are also odds-on favorites in their respective divisions.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs were 4.5-point favorites over the Lions in Thursday's season opener. The point spread dropped this week, from Kansas City -6.5, after news of tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> suffering a knee injury in practice. The Chiefs have officially listed Kelce as questionable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> slow down this season?</h2>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3139477.png&w=65&h=90&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\" width=\"50\"> There's no denying Mahomes' greatness, albeit I am an Eagles fan. An Eagles fan who will relive a Super Bowl LVII loss for the rest of my life. But I digress. Mahomes is not showing any signs of slowing, as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> are the favorite to win the Super Bowl (6-1), AFC (+350) and AFC West  (-170).</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Prop-wise, Mahomes is the favorite at 4-1 to have the most passing yards and 3-1 to have the most passing touchdowns, which isn't surprising given he led the league in those two categories last season. Mahomes also has the highest passing yards prop on Caesars at 4,750.5 (prior to news of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38333754/chiefs-te-travis-kelce-hyperextends-knee-ahead-opener\">injury</a>). Despite this prop number rising, Mahomes should be able to hit over this mark, given last season he had 11 players with at least 100 receiving yards. Plus, the AFC is going to be tight this year, so I don't see Mahomes resting at any point during the season.</p>\n<p>Mahomes won the regular season and Super Bowl MVPs, so it's no surprise he is the MVP favorite at 6-1. Don't forget, Mahomes was battling it out with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a> down the stretch last season to win regular-season MVP. That was until Hurts unfortunately injured his shoulder. Another sting for an Eagles fan. Again, I digress. Mahomes to win MVP, although the favorite, is not a terrible bet before the season. His MVP line should move down if he stays healthy and continues to put up video game numbers, but there can be value found elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Don't waste your moola betting a non-QB for MVP</h2>\n<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10452/adrian-peterson\">Adrian Peterson</a> was the last non-QB to win MVP. That was in 2012. I was a sophomore in high school and \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" was the No. 1 song of the year.</p>\n<p>The 22 shortest favorites to win the award are all quarterbacks. At 50-1, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a>, who will miss at minimum the first four games, has shorter odds to win than <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a> (60-1).</p>\n<p>My eyes are on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> at +950. If <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045138/mike-williams\">Mike Williams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15818/keenan-allen\">Keenan Allen</a> are able to stay healthy, Herbert can put up big numbers like he did in 2021, breaking <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a> season records for passing yards (5,014) and passing touchdowns (38). Plus, Kellen Moore takes over as offensive coordinator. (Side note: circle Week 6, <a href=\"https://preview.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a> at Chargers on MNF). Moore led the NFL's best offense in 2021 with Dallas and should be able to help Herbert get back to putting up big numbers.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Sportsbooks have no faith in Arizona ... and neither do I!</h2>\n\n\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ari.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"31\"> Tough year to be an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\">Arizona Cardinals</a> fan. The Cardinals are not favored in any games posted for this upcoming season. Arizona has the lowest win total of any team at 4.5, coming down from 5.5 wins a year ago. The Cardinals could easily go under their win total with a rookie head coach, rookie offensive and defensive coordinators and a rookie general manager. Plus, Kyler Murray is coming off an ACL injury.</p>\n<p>Arizona is also tied for the longest Super Bowl odds with the Texans at 200-1 and has the longest odds to win the NFC West at 40-1. For context, the team with the next longest odds to win their division is the Raiders at 15-1 to win the AFC West -- and that's with having to deal with the Chiefs, Chargers and Broncos.</p>\n<p>Things could get ugly ... really quick.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Oddsmakers have NFC North as most competitive division</h2>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a> went from a team I watched half asleep in a turkey coma on Thanksgiving to being favorites to win the division for the first time ever. Detroit (+140) is a trendy pick to win the division after exceeding expectations with nine wins last season. But I need to see it to believe it.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Minnesota Vikings</a> to win the division at +285 is enticing. The Vikings won 13 games last season, albeit they were 11-0 in one-score games. Sure, Minnesota is going to see regression, but by how much? The Vikings will be in contention, especially with the top wideout in the game. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a> could very well have the most receiving yards in the league (you can bet this at 6-1). He led the league with 1,809 receiving yards in 2022 and doesn't show signs of slowing under <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I'm not saying Detroit isn't going to be good. I'm not saying the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a> aren't going to improve. I'm not saying <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036378/jordan-love\">Jordan Love</a> is going to be terrible -- although I don't expect much from him. I am saying it is going to be a tight race in the NFC North, and based on the numbers, the Vikings seem like the best bet to win the division. Don't forget, betting division winners is not limited to the preseason. One can bet into these markets during the season as well.</p>\n\n\n<h2>I'm 'Erin on the side of caution' when betting the AFC champion</h2>\n\n\n<p>I should be taking side bets on the number of times I hear the \"the AFC is loaded\" per day on ESPN. Eight of the top 13 Super Bowl favorites are in the AFC. Mahomes reigns king, but big names like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, my MVP pick Justin Herbert -- and now <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, makes me nervous to pick a winner. Health is always imperative to winning these awards. That is the true gamble with all futures bets.</p>\n<p>If you were to bet a conference champion, the NFC seems much more predictable. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, Cowboys and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a> are clearly the class of the conference. It wouldn't come to a shock if any of those teams were representing the NFC in February, whereas the AFC feels entirely wide open.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Betting advice: Don't trip on trends</h2>\n\n\n<p>Trends alone aren't going to win you money.</p>\n<p>Last season, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants</a> finished 13-4 against the spread and 10-2 ATS as an underdog. Just because the Giants were the best ATS team last season, doesn't necessarily mean that will be the case in 2023.</p>\n<p>Another trend I heard a lot last year is betting against Kirk Cousins in prime time. I get it, his numbers aren't very good, going 11-17-1 in his career. But what if I told you that he's 7-8-1 in prime time while quarterbacking the Vikings, including 1-1 last season. The numbers are skewed because he was 2-10 in prime time while in Washington.</p>\n<p>Here's one you're going to hear a lot in Week 6: The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> are 0-12 vs. the Eagles. That's right, not one win for Gang Green vs. my Eagles. Does it mean anything this year? Absolutely not.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Lastly ...</h2>\n\n\n<p>Not to be pessimistic, but the 20-leg parlay dropped in your group chat probably isn't going to cash. Mix in a straight bet once in a while! Good luck this season.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- To the larger football world, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> burst onto the scene in 2018 in a spectacular way by throwing for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns and winning the MVP award in his first season as a starter.</p>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes spent his rookie season mostly hidden from public view as a backup to Alex Smith until the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> rested their starters in the final game of the regular season against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>But Mahomes' burgeoning talent wasn't a big surprise to his teammates and coaches.</p>\n\n\n<p>In Derrick Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14048/justin-houston\">Justin Houston</a>, Tamba Hali and Eric Berry, the Chiefs had a group of defensive players who combined for 17 Pro Bowls and five first-team All-Pro selections. But in 2017, they had seen nothing like the quarterback who played against them each day in practice.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"We were in awe of what he was doing,\" Johnson said. \"We'd sit around talking about the throws he made on us in practice. We'd all talk about how he got us with this play or that play.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"When it came time for the Broncos game, we all had our popcorn ready. We were sitting there saying, 'Watch this,' or 'Look at this.' We were starstruck when it came to the talent he had. There was no way he could throw the passes he could throw and not be successful.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Everyone who spent time around Mahomes during his rookie season has a story, when his star was beginning to rise. As the reigning MVP and two-time Super Bowl champion begins his seventh season on Thursday against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a> (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC), here are just a few of those tales.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>'It's a thing I can tell my kids'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Demetrius Harris, a backup tight end for the Chiefs at the time, is the answer to the trivia question: Who caught Patrick Mahomes' first career completion? Mahomes had thrown incompletions on the first two plays in the Week 17 game against the Broncos, leaving the Chiefs with a third-and-10 from their own 14 on their first drive.</p>\n\n\n<p>They called a play featuring vertical routes from each of the five receivers, a play the Chiefs named All Go Special. If ever a first completion foreshadowed a quarterback's career, this was it.</p>\n<alsosee>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes took the shotgun snap and passed the ball to the 6-foot-7 Harris, a former college basketball player. It was a strike 25 yards down the field and up high for Harris, over leaping Broncos safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971248/will-parks\">Will Parks</a>. The play wasn't over, as Harris ran after the catch before eventually being tackled for a 51-yard gain.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He threw it right on the money, right there,\" Harris said. \"You could see it then, that this kid was going to be special. There's not a lot of quarterbacks who could have made that throw. The coverage was pretty good actually, but he threw it on a dime and it wasn't just like a five-yard or a 10-yard pass.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It wasn't surprising to me. We saw it every day, day in and day out, at practice. He was doing all of these no-look passes in practice. It wasn't surprising when he started doing those in the games. The first time he did it in practice, I was like, 'Hold on. Did he really just throw that without looking at the receiver?' But then we saw it so much it wasn't shocking anymore.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The All Go Special was designed for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> to run the tight end's route down the middle of the field, but Kelce was held out of that game as the Chiefs rested their starters.</p>\n\n\n<p>Harris played eight NFL seasons for four teams, finishing with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\">Arizona Cardinals</a> in 2021. He caught 82 passes and 9 touchdowns. But Harris called the catch from Mahomes a career favorite.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It's a thing I can tell my kids,\" he said. \"I cherish the moment.\"</p>\n<photo1>\n\n\n<h2>'We never had that much fear for Alex Smith'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Chris Harris played for the Broncos in Mahomes' first game. He was eager to get a look at the rookie quarterback coming into the AFC West and wondering whether he would make the Chiefs a more difficult opponent.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He was coming into our division, so you pay attention when he got drafted,\" Harris said. \"We knew Alex Smith was good, but we never thought he was one of the top guys in the league. We never had that much fear for Alex Smith.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Then Mahomes came in, and in that game against us he showed off his scrambling ability and his throwing ability. His arm talent was off the charts. You could see it from that first throw to Harris. Then his scrambling ability, he was a different kind of scrambler. He was really smart with it and was always looking to throw when he did. We almost came back, and then Mahomes closed the game out for them. He showed right then he was a winner. From then on, we knew he was going to be hard to deal with. You could see he had the talent to be able to succeed in the league.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Denver has never beaten Mahomes. He is 11-0 against the Broncos, who owned the AFC West before Mahomes' arrival. Denver won the division title every season from 2011 through 2015.</p>\n<p>The division is now the domain of the Chiefs. They've won seven consecutive AFC West titles, the past five with Mahomes as their starting quarterback.</p>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes and Harris played for the AFC in the Pro Bowl after the 2018 season. Harris said he made a point to talk with Mahomes.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I let him know then I knew he was going to be pretty tough on us, seeing him twice each year,\" Harris said. \"It wasn't hard to see they were going to be a long-lasting dynasty. We had been dominating the division at the time, and then Mahomes came in and they pretty much took over the dominance in the division. Right now, I don't even think it's a rivalry. I don't know the last time we beat them.\"</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>'This quarterback is pretty good'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Derrick Johnson, a linebacker, was in his 13th and final season with the Chiefs in 2017, so the only Mahomes he knows is the one who was a backup. But he got to know Mahomes well on the practice field that year, when things didn't always go as planned for Johnson and the Chiefs on defense.</p>\n<inline1>\n\n\n<p>\"I never got fussed at from the coaches in practice like we were that year,\" Johnson said. \"Usually we know what the offense is going to do. We practice it. We know the plays. We just have to respond the right way. We'll make plays, get an interception here and there, knock some passes down. Very rarely does the offense make plays against us.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"That was the year, 2017, when the offense was making plays against us. I'm thinking, 'This quarterback is pretty good.' He was making it happen. I never had a scout team quarterback beat me as consistently as he did. Normally, if the scout team beats you or is making plays on you, it's not a good thing. Not at all. Usually that means you have to figure some things out. But it happened when Pat was the quarterback. It was because of Pat.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Johnson recalled the cat-and-mouse games he would play with Mahomes in those practice sessions, trying to trick the rookie quarterback into making a mistake.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"When he would run a [run-pass option], I would try to bait him,\" Johnson said. \"He would read me and I would move for the run, but just enough to make sure he threw the ball and I'll still be there to pick it off. I never got there. He threw it right by me. My coach was looking at me, yelling at me. But there was no way I could have gotten to that ball. There was nothing I could have done.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He was throwing no-look passes. I thought he was playing with us at times. I actually got upset, thought he was hot-dogging around by looking this way and throwing the ball that way. But that was him. That was what he does, the way he plays.\"</p>\n<photo2>\n\n\n<h2>'That was probably the moment where we all knew'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Brett Veach was promoted to Chiefs general manager in the summer of 2017, after Mahomes was drafted. But as the team's personnel director he was instrumental in identifying Mahomes as a top prospect early in his college career at Texas Tech and getting coach Andy Reid and then-general manager John Dorsey interested enough for the Chiefs to trade up to draft him.</p>\n\n\n<p>Veach's routine at training camp after practice is to retreat to the dorm room that doubles as his office and watch the morning's session again on video. That year, he watched the passes made by their rookie quarterback first before viewing the rest of practice.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I would literally sprint back to the dorm just to see his throws,\" Veach said. \"I would fast-forward through all the stuff that was most important, like how the projected starters looked. I would go right to Pat's segment of practice and then go back through the rest of it. It wasn't like it was just one throw. It was every day. There were countless numbers of crazy throws and a handful of no-look passes.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Veach was an interested spectator from up high in the press box during that season's game in Denver. He recalled the details from that day in Colorado, the 17-degree temperature and snow flurries at kickoff, the Chiefs pulling Mahomes from the game in the fourth quarter with a 14-point lead, the Broncos' coming back to tie and then Mahomes leading the winning drive by completing 4-of-5 passes for 52 yards.</p>\n\n\n<p>But all he really needed to see was that first third-down pass to Harris.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"That was probably the moment where we all knew,\" Veach said. \"That was one of those moments, where the signs became obvious he was destined to do some pretty good things.\"</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>'He was making sure I saw it, too'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Matt Nagy in 2017 was in the final season of his first go-round as Chiefs offensive coordinator. He left after the season to coach the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a>, returned to Kansas City last year and was promoted this season to his former position.</p>\n\n\n<p>He usually doesn't spend much time watching defensive drills during practice, instead working off to the side with the starting quarterback. But he would stop to watch Mahomes practice against the Chiefs' starting defense in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I was like everyone else,\" he said. \"I wanted to see it.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Most often, the defensive coordinator will instruct the quarterback where to throw the ball on any given play in order to help the defense prepare. That year's coordinator, Bob Sutton, didn't interfere, believing any work the defense could get against an improvising Mahomes was better preparation than anything he could script.</p>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes even got Reid out of his usual practice routine. Normally, the Chiefs practice at a fast pace, going from one play to the next with little delay. But after Mahomes threw his first no-look pass at a training camp practice, even Reid had to pause to appreciate the moment.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I looked at coach Reid and he was acting like he was looking at his play sheet,\" Nagy said. \"But he was looking out of the corner of his eye at me. He was making sure I saw it, too.\"</p>\n<video2>\n\n\n<h2>'He didn't get intimidated by the moment'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes acknowledged being too excited for the game in Denver. One of his first passes after the throw to Harris went well over the head of his intended receiver and was intercepted. He later blamed the overthrow on being too pumped for his first NFL game.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14951/mitchell-schwartz\">Mitchell Schwartz</a>, then the Chiefs' right tackle, said he couldn't see any nervousness on the part of the rookie quarterback, not that day nor during the week of preparation.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He just had this calmness about him and that seems to be natural for him,\" Schwartz said. \"He didn't get intimidated by the moment, and that's something you want to see on the road in Denver. In practice, when he's on the scout team, he can run around and chuck it and not really have to worry about things. The game is really when you get to know how someone can handle pressure situations. It was good to see. It was a fun game and it turned out well.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"That kind of solidified his status and his ability to lead a team in the future. Things were smooth the whole week in practice and you appreciate that. That tells you he was doing stuff Monday and Tuesday to prepare for the game.\"</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>'All right, I'm going to get him back'</h2>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes remembers one of the first no-look passes he threw on the Chiefs' practice field. The victim was Johnson, the veteran linebacker with tremendous instincts. Mahomes recalled the only way he was going to get the ball past Johnson, who otherwise would have been in the passing lane, was to look away from his intended receiver.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"If I had been looking at the receiver, he would have picked it off,\" Mahomes said. \"He'd picked me off earlier in practice that day, and I was like, 'All right, I'm going to get him back.' I did a no-look pass, and I remember it wasn't like he said anything. He looked at me and smiled. It was like he was saying, 'I see what you're doing there.'\"</p>\n\n\n<p>It's natural to wonder now, after what he's accomplished in his five seasons as a starter, how Mahomes and the Chiefs would have fared had he played as a rookie. Would he have a third MVP award? Would the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl that season?</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I think I would have had some success,\" Mahomes said recently. \"I don't think it would have happened as fast. I think there would have been a lot more mistakes, especially early in my career, early in my season. I think by the end of the year I could have figured some stuff out and made some stuff happen. I don't know if it would have been a Super Bowl run or anything like that but I think I hopefully could have gotten us into the playoffs.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Alex was way ahead of me at that point where he could run the offense the right way. He was playing so [well] that there was never a thought that I should be playing. I wasn't supposed to be playing. I was supposed to be learning.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Turns out, he was a pretty good student.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Cook has long been considered one of the best jukers in the league and was a 94 last season. Hill is probably the most fun non-quarterback to play with in the game, considering his speed (99), acceleration (99), agility (98), catching (94) and change of direction (99).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Five players outside the top five at their position to start a franchise with</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> (82 overall):</strong> Putting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> here would feel like cheating because he's close to the top five. Lawrence has good speed (87), enough arm strength (93), an 85 break sack rating and good accuracy numbers (88 short, 84 middle, 85 deep). Plus, at age 23, he has room to grow.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429084/anthony-richardson\">Anthony Richardson</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts</a> (70 overall):</strong> It's a close call between Richardson and Chicago's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a>, who was on this list last year, as young dual-threat quarterbacks you can build with. Valuing arm strength (Richardson is a 95, while Fields is a 91) over speed (Fields is a 93, Richardson a 91), Richardson is the better choice. Fields is more accurate (85 short, 79 medium, 82 deep) than Richardson (76 short, 75 medium, 76 deep), but both can improve. Plus Richardson (22) is two years younger, which matters in Madden.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035631/brian-burns\">Brian Burns</a>, OLB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers</a> (87 overall):</strong> If you want to build defensively, Burns is the place to start. He's No. 7 among left outside linebackers and is just 25 years old. His 88 speed and 91 acceleration will be problematic for opposing offensive lineman, and his 79 hit power combined with his 87 finesse moves rating will help, too.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242283/rashawn-slater\">Rashawn Slater</a>, LT, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> (85 overall): </strong>To be fair, this is not the most exhilarating place to build a franchise. But Madden offensive linemen are tougher to develop and at age 24, Slater is one of the best. Plus, he's going to protect your quarterback's blind side for a long time. Slater edged another 24-year-old, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361985/christian-darrisaw\">Christian Darrisaw</a>, because his pass-block rating is a little better (87 to 84), although Darrishaw is a better run-blocker (89 to 87). It's a close call because Darrishaw is a slightly better pass-blocker against power (87 to 86), but you can't go wrong either way.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239995/aj-terrell\">A.J. Terrell</a> Jr., CB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Atlanta Falcons</a> (87 overall):</strong> Like Slater, Terrell was on this list last year, too. At age 24, he's rated high enough he could get to a 99 faster than most, and both <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372012/pat-surtain-ii\">Pat Surtain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427250/sauce-gardner\">Sauce Gardner</a> are already top five at the position. Terrell's 92 speed and acceleration are valuable. While his 83 man coverage rating is a little concerning, his 92 zone coverage rating is excellent. Safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034790/antoine-winfield-jr\">Antoine Winfield Jr</a>. -- especially if you control the position defensively -- is intriguing because he has an 89 speed rating with 91 acceleration and an 88 zone coverage rating. And he is just 25.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Teams you do and don't want to play with</h2>\n<p><strong>Top teams overall:</strong> Chiefs (92), Eagles (91), Bills (90)<br>\n<strong>Bottom teams overall:</strong> Cardinals (72), Rams (73), Titans (74)</p>\n<p><strong>Top offenses:</strong> Chiefs (91), Bengals (91), Eagles (90)<br>\n<strong>Bottom offenses:</strong> Packers (69), Commanders (70), Titans (71)</p>\n<p><strong>Top defenses:</strong> Bills (88), 49ers (88), Cowboys (87)<br>\n<strong>Bottom defenses:</strong> Cardinals (66), Rams (67), Texans (72)</p>\n<p><strong>Top special teams:</strong> Ravens (90), Raiders (83), Chiefs (82)<br>\n<strong>Bottom special teams:</strong> Broncos (66), Titans (66), Cowboys (66)</p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<p>While the Chiefs are the best team in the game, they are not close to balanced, which could be a problem if you're not a good defensive player. The team's 81 defensive rating is close to the middle of the league.</p>\n<p>Buffalo is the most balanced team in the game (90 overall, 89 offense, 88 defense), with Dallas (88 overall, 88 offense, 87 defense), Cleveland (87 overall, 85 offense, 83 defense) and Miami (86 overall, 83 offense, 86 defense) offering more than Kansas City.</p>\n<p>The Cardinals and Rams defenses are the lowest rated since at least Madden 20 -- and consider how bad the Rams' virtual defense is considering Aaron Donald is on it. The biggest challenge in the game would be playing as Arizona, the lowest-rated team but also one without a defense that can do much and with an offense that could be difficult to move.</p>\n<p>If you're playing as Arizona in franchise mode, at least you'll have two first-round picks to play with after the 2023 season.</p>\n<p>Depending on your style of play, the Dolphins would probably be the most fun team to use in the game if you like speed and big-play offense. If you like getting after quarterbacks and causing defensive havoc, the Cowboys and 49ers will likely fit you quite well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Last year, with average wide receiver play, he threw for 5250 yards. His top WR was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a>, and now he's gone -- replaced by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore\">Skyy Moore</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney\">Kadarius Toney</a>, but I don't really think the WRs matter. As long as Kelce's still in town I'm on team Mahomes to lead the league in passing yards. He's beat 4750 passing yards in back-to-back seasons, and was just 10 yards short (4,740) in 2020. <em><u><strong>I'm taking the OVER</strong></u></em> on 4,750 for Mahomes this year. I love optimism right off the bat!</p>\n<p><strong>Liz: </strong>I'm with you 100%, DD. Mahomes is the ultimate problem solver, able to deliver to all levels of the field... and with both hands. His ability to adjust sans Tyreek -- pressing pause on the deep ball and, instead, peppering the middle of the field -- was shockingly seamless. Mahomes' current corps all have speed and/or YAC ability for days, which should keep his passing stats <em><strong><u>OVER</u></strong></em>-ly robust.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3918298.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> O/U 575.5 rushing yards</h3>\n<p><strong>Liz: </strong>Allen might be the only QB to threaten Showtime's standing as fantasy's QB1. Mahomes may have thrown for 1,000 more yards, but Allen used his legs to clear 760 rushing yards (more than doubling Mahome's 2022 rushing numbers) for the second year in a row. While it's thrilling to watch Allen exit the pocket (more than 7 times per game) and move like a man possessed, it's also dangerous. After last year's elbow injury, Sean McDermott has been clear about wanting the former Wyoming Cowboy to tame his playing style. I think it's fair, therefore, to anticipate fewer designed runs (Allen recorded the fifth-most last year) for the 27-year-old in 2023. But they're not going away completely and Allen isn't changing what makes him special in a season. <em><strong><u>I'll take the OVER </u></strong></em>on 575.5 rushing yards (while expecting a regression from 700).</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>You laid out the argument pretty perfectly, Liz. I'm worried the Bills will want to preserve Allen for the long term by asking him to run less, but they also don't want to completely change who he is as a quarterback. They've gotta let him use his legs and be the rushing weapon he is. That's just part of Allen's makeup! <strong><u><em>I'm with you on taking the over</em></u></strong> on 575.5 rushing yards, while also seeing a regression in his total rushing number.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/8439.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> O/U 3,925.5 passing yards</h3>\n<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>Rodgers looked like a different quarterback last year. He wasn't the dominate force we've come to expect, and that was in large part because he lost his No. 1 target in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a>. Green Bay replaced that one guy with two guys: 2nd round rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4248528/christian-watson\">Christian Watson</a> and Allan Lazard.</p>\n<p>Rodgers' play suffered, culminating in a humiliating Week 18 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a>, keeping him out of the playoffs in his final season as a Green Bay Packer. I mean, that may have been one of the best moments of my life, watching Rodgers walk off the field as deflated as Patriots AFC Championship game football.</p>\n<p>But we're not here to talk about me, we're talking about Rodgers throwing at least 3,925.5 passing yards this season. My initial instinct is to take the over because coming into last year, he'd beaten that number for four consecutive seasons, but I am a little worried because when Rodgers did that he was seeing the two of the bottom 10 teams in the league (Lions and Bears) four times a season. He won't have those cake games in his division this year. The Jets were 6th in pass attempts (and dead last in completion percentage -- ouch) but that's also because they lost <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427366/breece-hall\">Breece Hall</a> in Week 7 and couldn't ground and pound with their defense they way they wanted to, so <em><u><strong>I'm actually going to take the UNDER</strong></u></em> on this bet. What say you, Liz. There's more room on this anti-Rodgers bandwagon for another NFC North fan!</p>\n<p><strong>Liz: </strong>There are always so many words about Aaron Rodgers. I agree with nearly all of yours. After 18 years of my Bears being owned by him, <u><strong><em>I will happily bet the UNDER</em></strong></u>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4360310.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> O/U 4,050.5 passing yards</h3>\n<p><strong>Liz: </strong>Speaking of getting owned. Lawrence looked pretty good with Urban Meyer out the door, huh? Flashing that loudly touted generational talent, Lawrence closed out his sophomore campaign with twice as many passing scores (25) and half as many INTs (8). Another year in Doug Pederson's offense along with the addition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\">Calvin Ridley</a> and a top-eight strength of schedule have me believing in TLaw's QB1 fantasy potential. But, here's the thing. He's still only 23-years-old. And the Jags offensive line is troubling. I think it's likely he'll pass for 4,100 yards, but a few bad decisions and a couple of hard hits... and that's a losing bet. Because this prop is so close to my projection, <u><strong><em>I'm going with the UNDER</em></strong></u>.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>What a tough line to figure out for Lawrence! I too want to take the over because of all the things you mentioned -- we think he's taking another step forward and this offense should be better, but I'm with you on not feeling like there's not quite enough here for me to take the over, <em><u><strong>I'll go UNDER as well</strong></u></em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4239086.png&w=350&h=254&transparent=true\" width=\"100\"></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239086/desmond-ridder\">Desmond Ridder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Atlanta Falcons</a> O/U 15.5 passing TDs</h3>\n<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>This one's gonna be fun. I'm really intrigued to see what Ridder looks like this year. A 3rd round pick out of Cincinnati last year, Ridder started the final four games and threw only two touchdowns. To his credit, he didn't throw a pick either, which is impressive in 115 attempts as a rookie. This is really hard for me because I really do think Ridder can average more than 1 TD per game as the full time starter this year. But it's mostly anecdotal for me. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426502/drake-london\">Drake London</a> heading into year 2, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360248/kyle-pitts\">Kyle Pitts</a> getting healthy and the addition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430807/bijan-robinson\">Bijan Robinson</a>, who will also be heavily utilized in the passing game, I'm taking the optimistic approach here and expecting a 2nd year bump for Ridder. He has a phenomenal young trio surrounding him and I think they can put him over the top here. <u><em><strong>I'm taking the OVER</strong></em></u>.</p>\n<p><strong>Liz:</strong> It's the London/Pitts/Robinson of it for me, too! I get that Ridder has some real accuracy issues to overcome, but he showed in college that he could confidently produce in the pocket once he was able to establish a rhythm. The pass-catchers in Atlanta are melody makers. If Ridder doesn't clear the above line it's because he's benched for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2565969/taylor-heinicke\">Taylor Heinicke</a> (which I'm never not here for). <u><em><strong>I'm taking the OVER too</strong></em></u>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

But what makes that arm strength even more impressive is how he pairs it with exceptional accuracy down the field. No offense likes to find itself playing behind the sticks, but Allen's powerful right arm leaves a defense feeling vulnerable on any down, including third-and-long situations. <em>-- Yates</em></p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> I'm a little surprised <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a> didn't crack the top 10. Even after a down season, he still has an absolute cannon to hit the deep balls. His 30 completions thrown at least 20 yards downfield last season tied with Allen for No. 1 in the NFL. Strength-wise, his arm is still very much top-10-caliber, and I'm expecting to see deep shots in Denver's game plan more often this year. <em>-- Orlovsky</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> There were only six passes that averaged 50 mph while the ball was in the air last season, per NFL Next Gen Stats -- and three of them were thrown by Herbert. (All three went incomplete, but just being able to throw that hard is impressive.) <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> generates a lot of velocity behind his throws and can fit them into tight windows, and his downfield accuracy could increase significantly this season with improved personnel around him. With a few deep-ball completions to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\">DJ Moore</a> in his third pro season, he could be on this list by next summer. <em>-- Jordan Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> Leaving <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a> out of the top 10 is extremely questionable. He's a high RPM thrower who can attack all three levels of the field thanks to his arm strength, and the ball still explodes out of his hand. I'm also surprised Fields or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a> weren't on here -- they both have a case. <em>-- Bowen</em></p>\n<p><a name=\"accuracy\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Others who received at least one vote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361418/will-levis\">Will Levis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4383351/trey-lance\">Trey Lance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Accuracy</h2>\n<p>Arm strength doesn't mean much if you can't place the ball where it needs to go.

What jumps off the game tape, they say, is that Burrow not only invariably places the ball in good windows for receivers to attempt to make a play on it, but he also has a knack of delivering passes with ideal touch on every throw in the route tree. That combination regularly leaves defenses frustrated. And Rodgers -- entering his 19th season -- is No. 2 behind Burrow because, more often than not, he still puts receivers in a great position to succeed. <em>-- Jason Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> I'm pretty shocked that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> isn't on this list. You don't throw the ball with success as much as he does without accuracy. I would have guessed there would be more appreciation for how hard it is to be an accurate passer -- which he is at this stage of his career -- when you run the ball as much as he does (100-plus carries in four straight seasons). He now has three straight seasons with 35 or more TD throws, and he was only off target on 14.7% of his throws in 2022. <em>-- Hasselbeck</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> Over the past two seasons, only two quarterbacks with at least 300 attempts have recorded a completion percentage over expectation (CPOE) of plus-3% or higher, per NFL Next Gen Stats. One is Burrow (plus-4.1%), who ranked No. 1 on our list. The other? Fifth-ranked Smith, all the way up at plus-4.8%. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> Combine the talent of Lawrence as a thrower and another year of coaching from quarterback guru Doug Pederson, and it's natural to think T-Law is in for a huge step up in his development in 2023. We saw glimpses last year, as Lawrence led the Jaguars to the divisional round of the playoffs while completing 66.3% of his passes for 25 touchdowns to just eight interceptions. With a better supporting cast and more experience, he should soon be recognized as one of the league's most accurate throwers. <em>-- Miller</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> The biggest snub was Lawrence. He was greatly improved last year, going from a 59.6% completion percentage as a rookie to 66.3% in his second year. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\">Calvin Ridley</a> reemerging after his suspension and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051876/evan-engram\">Evan Engram</a> signed to a long-term contract, Lawrence and this entire Jacksonville passing offense should take a major stride forward in 2023. <em>-- Tannenbaum</em></p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p><a name=\"touch\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Others who received at least one vote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Touch</h2>\n<p>It's not only about pass velocity or placement. How the ball gets there is also key. Successful quarterbacks need to master trajectory, whether it's fitting the ball in a tight spot with zip or softly dropping it in over a receiver's shoulder.

But touch is about more than that, as Burrow has an uncanny ability to blend accuracy, velocity, trajectory and feel that leads to making throws into tight windows look far easier than they actually are to complete. <em>-- Yates</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a> should be in the top 10. I've made the case that no quarterback in the NFL threw more perfect passes last season than Smith, and many of those throws were downfield with perfect trajectory and pace on the football. He actually belongs in the top eight here. <em>-- Orlovsky</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> Over the past two seasons, Rodgers leads quarterbacks in CPOE when targeting corner routes (plus-13%), and that's a pass that often requires excellent touch. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> He's only a redshirt sophomore and hasn't been drafted yet, but North Carolina's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4431452/drake-maye\">Drake Maye</a> is someone to watch in this category in the future. He has an especially great feel for deep throws to targets along the sideline, and it helped him hit 63 completions on passes of 20-plus air yards last season, the fifth-best mark in the country. <em>-- Jordan Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> I was shocked to see <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a> missing here. Yes, he can throw absolute lasers, but let's not forgot about his ability to deliver the ball with both touch and pace. It allows Stafford to layer throws over the second level of the defense or drop the ball into a bucket downfield.

Who are the most technically sound signal-callers in the league?</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a><br>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">Jets</a><br>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a><br>\n4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a><br>\nT-5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Cowboys</a><br>\nT-5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jaguars</a><br>\nT-7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Bills</a><br>\nT-7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Vikings</a><br>\n9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Dolphins</a><br>\nT-10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Rams</a><br>\nT-10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Best of the best:</strong> Burrow's completion percentages in each of his first three NFL seasons speak for themselves: 65.3%, 70.4% and 68.3%. But the foundation of those sparkling numbers is Burrow's nearly flawless mechanics. His footwork on drops, his arm angles on throws, his throwing delivery -- Burrow is a model of efficiency at all of it. And although Rodgers comes in at No. 2 on the list, he might be the greatest of all time in this area and remains masterful. <em>-- Jason Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> It sure seems like we have come a long way with what is considered sound mechanics. The top four QBs on this list all have an ability to change arm angles and find ways to get the ball out quickly. And with this new appreciation for different ways to be \"sound\" throwing the football, it's hard to shake guys like Lawrence, Cousins and Tagovailoa off the list. <em>-- Hasselbeck</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> We've heard a lot about the work ethic of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, and that has helped him rework his mechanics since his Alabama days. He now has a looser throwing motion, crisper footwork and less wasted motion in his delivery. NFL analysts will soon be calling Hurts' mechanics some of the finest in football. <em>-- Miller</em></p>\n<p><video3></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> To echo Matt Miller, Hurts is probably already the biggest snub here. We saw some real improvement from him all of last season, but I think his flawless mechanics stood out most in the Super Bowl, when he completed 71.1% of his passes. <em>-- Tannenbaum</em></p>\n<p><a name=\"vision\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Others who received at least one vote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill\">Ryan Tannehill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Field vision</h2>\n<p>Here we're looking at the ability to read the field. Included in that are awareness and recognition when it comes to seeing defensive schemes or coverages, along with the fast eyes to identify blitzers, breaking defensive backs and open targets. Will a QB audible out when he needs to, diagnosing and understanding different defensive looks? And how quickly can he get through his progressions? Does he get stuck on his first read too often and stare down receivers, making it easy for the defense? Or can he scan the field, make the defense bite with his eyes and then find the open receiver?</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a><br>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a><br>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">Jets</a><br>\n4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Bills</a><br>\n5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a><br>\n6. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a><br>\n7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jaguars</a><br>\n8. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Dolphins</a><br>\n9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Cowboys</a><br>\n10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Rams</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Best of the best:</strong> There are so many things that make defending Mahomes a near-impossible task, but near the top of the list is that no play is ever over. That's because Mahomes seemingly has a 360-degree view of every play, tracking both what is taking place right around him and what is happening down the field. His instincts and vision -- combined with his ability to elude pressure -- form a dangerous skill set. <em>-- Yates</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> should be in the top 10. The Minnesota offense asks a lot of him when it comes to seeing the field and reading it out, often with multiple layers of progressions. He does it at a very high level. <em>-- Orlovsky</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> Over the past three seasons, Mahomes has recorded the lowest rate of tight-window throws (10%), and his targets have had the most separation on average (3.8), per NFL Next Gen Stats. I often caution against using those metrics without further context, but I will say I think those numbers have a lot more to do with Mahomes and the Chiefs' scheme than the team's receivers. Since those stats are generated only on targets, it shows Mahomes is throwing to receivers who have separated, a credit to his ability to read the field. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> Lawrence took a huge leap during his second season under coach Doug Pederson, but he could make an even bigger one this year. He looked more poised and in control in 2022, and with 20 of his 25 touchdown passes coming against man coverage, Lawrence thrived when teams attempted to play his receivers with one-on-one looks. If we see a jump in production against zone coverage, he will likely be in the top five of this category next summer. I'll also quickly mention USC's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams\">Caleb Williams</a>; the potential No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft has an innate feel for the entire field. <em>-- Jordan Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a> sees it fast on both play-action and drop-back concepts, and he can hit defined windows or take the throws that are available. And in Detroit's heavily schemed pass game, he can set his throwing window to quickly deliver the ball. I'd also like to see Kirk Cousins and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a> on this list. <em>-- Bowen</em></p>\n<p><a name=\"decisions\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Others who received at least one vote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241464/mac-jones\">Mac Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill\">Ryan Tannehill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Decision-making with the football</h2>\n<p>This one is pretty straightforward. Avoiding turnovers, protecting the football, not taking unnecessary risks and keeping an offense out of harm's way lead to better efficiency. Forcing a pass into double-coverage or attempting too many low-percentage plays can get you into trouble in a hurry. Strong decision-making means fewer opportunities for the other team -- and likely more points for yours.</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a><br>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a><br>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">Jets</a><br>\n4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a><br>\n5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a><br>\n6. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a><br>\n7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seahawks</a><br>\n8. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Vikings</a><br>\n9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Bills</a><br>\n10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Dolphins</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Best of the best:</strong> It's easy to focus on the fact that Mahomes dazzles with no-look and behind-the-back passes, but most importantly, he keeps the Chiefs moving down the field by taking care of the football. As defenses adjusted after Mahomes' spectacular start to his career, regularly playing deep coverages designed to prevent his signature big plays, he, too, changed his approach. Instead of forcing balls into double coverage, which often results in turnovers, Mahomes became a tactician on short- and medium-range passes. And obviously, the results have been spectacular for the Chiefs. <em>-- Jason Reid</em></p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> I am really surprised Rodgers wasn't at the top of this list. Sure, 2022 was an ugly season for him, but we know he was dealing with a thumb injury. His track record of being aggressive with the football but also not turning it over is second to none. Before throwing 12 interceptions last year, he went four straight years with five or fewer and hadn't been in the double digits since 2010. <em>-- Hasselbeck</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a> didn't crack our collective top 10, but the Jaguars passer had a 1.3% interception rate (sixth best) and 4.3% sack rate (fourth best) last season, all while playing behind an offensive line that ranked 31st in pass block win rate. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> In two seasons as Ohio State's starter, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a> had 85 touchdown passes and just 12 interceptions. He established himself as an elite decision-maker, and not just in limiting turnovers. He always knows where to go with the football, how to attack a defense and how to set his playmakers up for success. That'll carry over to the pros as soon as he acclimates to the speed of the NFL game with the Texans. <em>-- Miller</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a>! No quarterback improved more in this area in 2022 than Jones, who had only five interceptions and six fumbles last season under the guidance of coach Brian Daboll. With pass-catcher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576925/darren-waller\">Darren Waller</a> added to the mix in New York, I expect a similar season out of Jones in 2023. <em>-- Tannenbaum</em></p>\n<p><a name=\"compete\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Others who received at least one vote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy\">Brock Purdy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett\">Jacoby Brissett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Compete level and toughness</h2>\n<p>Who has the most desire to win?

The Chiefs have found themselves in precarious situations often -- even in the playoffs -- and perpetually overcome them. A double-digit lead is far from safe against Kansas City, and that starts with Mahomes' unflappable nature. He believes his team will always win, and more often than not, he's very right. <em>-- Yates</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> I would probably have Hurts even higher when it comes to toughness. Cracking the top three is tough given the names occupying those spots, but it's also pretty hard to envision a guy who might be the best leader in football not appearing in that elite group at the top of the list. <em>-- Orlovsky</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> Fields was contacted on 42% of action plays last season, by far the highest among quarterbacks in the league. Consider that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota\">Marcus Mariota</a> ranked second ... at 32%. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240703/kenny-pickett\">Kenny Pickett</a> could rise quickly in this category. He isn't afraid to take off and use his legs, and he has already displayed a high level of toughness and grit.

He has total command of the pocket and displays an uncanny ability to sense edge rushers closing from his blind side. Mahomes climbs the pocket deftly, spins to open areas smoothly or extends plays when necessary. His knack for eluding the rush while remaining in the pocket infuriates defensive players. While Burrow and Rodgers don't quite match Mahomes' moves in the pocket, they are darn good in this spot, too. <em>-- Jason Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> I didn't think Hurts would end up <em>this high</em> on the list. The subtle pocket movement that we witnessed Tom Brady do so well shows up with guys like Burrow, Rodgers and Mahomes, but it's harder to find in many quarterbacks. I wasn't expecting to see Hurts at No. 6. <em>-- Hasselbeck</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> Mahomes had a 0.11 sack-to-pressure ratio last season, best in the NFL (Herbert was second at 0.15). And it was no fluke. Mahomes has led the NFL in that category in three of the past five years, and he finished second in the other two. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> Let's go back to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401403868\">September 2022</a>, when Alabama was trailing Texas by two points with 27 seconds left. That's when <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685720/bryce-young\">Bryce Young</a> made a play that sums up his high-level pocket presence. A Texas cornerback executed a perfectly timed blitz and made contact with Young in the backfield, but he shrugged off the would-be tackler, broke the pocket while keeping his eyes scanning the field and eventually <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/34562969\">ran for a first down</a> in a game-changing play that led to an Alabama victory. That's what the Panthers' No. 1 overall pick is bringing to the pros and why he already received votes here before even strapping on pads in an NFL game. <em>-- Miller</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>'s movement traits and instincts in the pocket have allowed him to play at a high level for a long time, so I would have expected him to make the top 10. But <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy\">Brock Purdy</a> is a close second for me as the biggest snub.

I'd argue yes, as his combination of speed and agility completely changes the equation for the Ravens' offense every single play. He's unstoppable as a runner, averaging 6.1 yards per carry over five seasons and posting two campaigns with 1,000-plus yards on the ground. <em>-- Yates</em></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> I'd personally have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> in the top 10, and I'd probably drop Herbert out. Herbert barely runs (14th in QB rushes last season at 54), whereas Burrow scrambles a ton (75 carries in 2022, seventh most). Burrow is very much like Mahomes in the sense he can situationally break your back with a timely run. I'll also be interested to see if Richardson can get into the top three by next season. <em>-- Orlovsky</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> We're combining designed runs and scrambles here, but I like to think of those as separate skills. In terms of designed runs, Hurts was the clear No. 1 in expected points added last season (48.2, almost double every other QB). But he ranked only sixth in EPA on scrambles, with Fields (45.8) and Allen (43.3) leading the way there. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> Young quarterbacks can rely on their mobility as they adjust to the pro game. Orlovsky mentioned Richardson, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685720/bryce-young\">Bryce Young</a> is also more than capable as a runner. He won't rip off a ton of straight-ahead chunk plays, but I see some similarity to Murray in how he stretches defenses with slippery playmaking ability outside the structure of the offense. <em>-- Jordan Reid</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> With an ability to produce on both designed carries and scramble attempts, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a> has the dual-threat traits to create conflict for opposing defenses as a runner.

Quarterbacks won't always be able to sit in the pocket and throw darts. With pressure coming off the edge or up the middle, getting outside the pocket and making off-schedule throws on the run is important in today's game. Those are the off-platform passes from different arm angles and body positions -- often on the move -- and can be the difference between eventual points and a stalled drive.</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a><br>\n2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Bills</a><br>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">Jets</a><br>\n4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Ravens</a><br>\nT-5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a><br>\nT-5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a><br>\n7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a><br>\n8. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\">Cardinals</a><br>\n9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jaguars</a><br>\n10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Bears</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Best of the best:</strong> Mahomes is so far ahead of the pack in this area that he's really in a category of one. Coaches say NFL quarterbacks make their money on third down and off-schedule plays, and Mahomes is simply dominant in both areas. As great as he is in the pocket, he's <em>even more</em> dangerous when forced from it. He's comfortable delivering passes from myriad arm angles while on the run, keeping would-be tacklers off balance. It's the best part of his game, and that's saying something. <em>-- Jason Reid</em></p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><strong>Biggest surprise:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a> was very good at creating offense with second-reaction plays in Houston. It seemed like the Texans lived in empty looks, and he was able to extend plays to find something better. But after nearly two full seasons off the field -- including an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34412381/source-cleveland-browns-qb-deshaun-watson-suspended-11-games-fined-5m-settlement-nfl-nflpa\">11-game suspension</a> -- and a disappointing return to it late last season, there seems to be a big departure from where his off-schedule playmaking was in 2020. <em>-- Hasselbeck</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stat to know:</strong> Herbert led the league last season in number of throws while moving at least 8 mph, per NFL Next Gen Stats, with 120. While Burrow trailed way behind in quantity (47), he made up for it with incredible efficiency, generating 0.53 EPA per play on those throws. No other QB was higher than 0.32. <em>-- Walder</em></p>\n<p><strong>Riser to watch:</strong> Rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429084/anthony-richardson\">Anthony Richardson</a> can quickly climb the ranks in the second-reaction category, but we have to mention USC superstar and likely No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams\">Caleb Williams</a>. His ability to make plays happen and create from off-platform throws already has scouts comparing him to Mahomes.

He should make this top 10 next year before even playing a pro game. <em>-- Miller</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snubbed:</strong> While not necessarily known for this trait, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a> does a really good job of extending plays and keeping his eye level down the field. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a> also greatly improved in this area last season, ranking sixth in QBR outside the pocket (65.6). <em>-- Tannenbaum</em></p>\n<p><strong>Others who received at least one vote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Jacobs had been a solid statistical performer during his first three NFL seasons, twice ending up an RB2 and once slipping into the top 10 among season scorers at his position, but he was never a superstar. Certainly not like he was in 2022.</p>\n<p>Last season, Jacobs played at a superstar level. Sans a long-term contract and in what could have been his final season with the organization, the Raiders gifted him with ridiculous volume and Jacobs thrived. No player had more touches, rushing yards or yards from scrimmage. Only two running backs --<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3068267/austin-ekeler\">Austin Ekeler</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a> -- and nine players scored more PPR points.</p>\n<p>This is a trap, fantasy managers. Jacobs entered last season an RB2 option, playing for a new deal he did not get. Perhaps you have heard, but he's not the only angry, bitter running back in the league. Teams are financially cautious with the position. Jacobs isn't pleased. He's not at training camp and is a risk to sit out regular-season games.</p>\n<p>However, even if Jacobs were signed long term and happy, he was unlikely to replicate his fantastic season with another 300-plus PPR points. Sure, we love the big volume while it is happening, but we have myriad cases of running backs failing to approach their numbers -- volume or efficiency -- the following season as proof of it, and it makes Jacobs a prime player to avoid at his current top-20 position in ESPN <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/football/livedraftresults\">average live drafts</a>.</p>\n<p>Entering 2022, a mere eight running backs received 310 or more rushing attempts in a season (<i>big</i> volume, for this era) over the past decade, and here are their results the next season.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12514/lesean-mccoy\">LeSean McCoy</a> topped 310 rushing attempts in consecutive seasons (2013, 2014) and never did so again. The Eagles traded him to the Bills in 2015, and he missed four games. He enjoyed one more RB1 season.</li>\n<li>DeMarco Murray ran wild for the 2014 Cowboys, handling 392 rushing attempts. He was an Eagle the next season (replacing McCoy), and he could not stay healthy (8 starts, 193 rushing attempts). His final season was 2017.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10452/adrian-peterson\">Adrian Peterson</a>, then 30, rushed 327 times for the 2015 Vikings. A series of injuries kept him to 13 games over the next two seasons, as he jumped from team to team. He never approached 300 touches again.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051392/ezekiel-elliott\">Ezekiel Elliott</a> enjoyed his best season as a rookie in 2016, and he missed six games the following season. He rebounded to sneak past 300 rushing attempts in 2018 and 2019, but never had an efficient season like 2016 again. At 28, he is currently looking for work.</li>\n<li>Le'Veon Bell topped 300 rushing attempts one time, in 2017, and then he held out for a bigger contract and sat out the next season. He played three more seasons for four teams, never again a fantasy factor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116593/dalvin-cook\">Dalvin Cook</a> slid past 310 rushing attempts over 14 games in 2020, and the next season, in one fewer game, he had 63 fewer attempts and more than 100 fewer PPR points. As with Elliott, as of this writing, he is not with an NFL team.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043078/derrick-henry\">Derrick Henry</a> used his 378 rushes to sail past 2,000 rushing yards in 2020, and then he missed half of the 2021 season because of injury. He bounced back nicely last season, but unlike others on this list, plays little role in the passing game, and is quite a bit larger than the others.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242335/jonathan-taylor\">Jonathan Taylor</a> was fantasy's best player in 2021. Let's just say he was not fantasy's best player in 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a clear theme here of a big-volume season portending injury and also of NFL teams looking to move on from players before that happens. Fantasy managers should notice the trends. Among the above group of players, the average rushing season following the year after the big volume -- for those who played -- fell short of 1,000 yards. Most missed games. Jacobs was awesome and won fantasy leagues, but we must look forward, not back.</p>\n<p>Also, perhaps we should be writing a positive article about Derrick Henry, for he is the rare exception of a player who can handle large volume year after year, topping 300 rushing attempts in three of four seasons. He remains effective, likely in part to his build. The other running backs have not held up as well. They get hurt. They see their volume fall. They are not as effective.</p>\n<p>Give Jacobs full credit for last season, when he played through myriad injuries, but things are different now. The Raiders remain uncommitted to him long term but are far more likely to share his usage, assuming he even suits up in Week 1. There is real risk here. Jacobs also seems far more likely to sit games to nurse injury, too. It hardly means Jacobs will be a notable bust, as he was a solid RB2 choice his first few seasons, but those choosing him over a top-end wide receiver might regret the move.</p>\n<p>Here are other players fantasy managers should be wary of selecting <em>at their current ADP spot</em>. After all, who wouldn't take Jacobs in Round 4 or 5? It's all about value.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<h2>Top and Second Quarterbacks</h2>\n<p>Nothing against awesome Chiefs star <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a></b>, awesome Bills star <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a></b> and awesome Eagles star <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a></b> -- yes, we admit they are quite awesome -- but there is little justification for using a top-20 pick on a quarterback in a one-quarterback format. Don't do it. You might not <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/38035040/2023-fantasy-football-draft-strategy-quarterback-qb\">wish to wait as long as I do to choose a QB</a> -- good ones are there in Round 10 or later -- but too many safe, top flex options (RB/WR) are available in Rounds 2 or 3 to take a quarterback that early, and the pickings get slim after Round 5.</p>\n<p>Later on in drafts, we should have reservations about Dolphins starter <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a></b> remaining healthy, Panthers rookie <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685720/bryce-young\">Bryce Young</a></b> becoming consistent and reliable so soon and Cardinals runner <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a></b> even playing in an NFL game before mid-October, as he recovers from major knee surgery. However, there's plenty of other good quarterbacks to draft, and with so much depth (<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>), there isn't even any need for a second QB in standard leagues; just wait for the bye week. Take traditional flex depth instead.</p>\n<h2>Running backs coming off ACL tears</h2>\n<p><inline1>While history isn't kind to running backs such as Jacobs coming off major volume, it is similarly discouraging for running backs with surgically repaired knees, at least in their first season back. Jets rookie <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427366/breece-hall\">Breece Hall</a></b> is going to have a hard time flirting with RB1 status -- he is the No. 12 RB off the board -- if he misses September games, and he certainly might. The Jets have made no secret of their flirtations with veteran RBs such as Elliott and Cook. It's a sign. Draft Hall in 2024.</p>\n<p>Exciting Bronco <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361579/javonte-williams\">Javonte Williams</a></b> tore his ACL and MCL a few weeks prior to Hall going down, but it is a more serious injury with different, longer rehabilitation, and the franchise is hardly guaranteeing Williams will play in September. The difference here is Williams is not being selected among the top 30 running backs in ADP. Round 10 is fine for him, if he lasts. Round 6 is not.</p>\n<h2>Running backs with adjusted situations</h2>\n<p>Going in ADP order, I have reservations about new Panthers starter <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045163/miles-sanders\">Miles Sanders</a></b>, longtime Saints pass-catcher <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054850/alvin-kamara\">Alvin Kamara</a></b>, Eagles acquisition <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259545/d'andre-swift\">D'Andre Swift</a></b> and Lions newcomer <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035538/david-montgomery\">David Montgomery</a></b>.</p>\n<p>Sanders flourished behind Philadelphia's elite offensive line, and as with others mentioned previously, the team had little intention in keeping him around, so it was not concerned about high volume. Now Sanders, who hasn't caught 30 passes in any of the past three seasons and has struggled to remain healthy, must play with a rookie QB and with an average offensive line. As noted by colleague Mike Clay, Sanders' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/insider/story/_/id/38118099/fantasy-football-jamaal-williams-george-kittle-2023-touchdown-projections-insight\">touchdown output</a> seems likely to crater. Sanders is likely not an RB2.</p>\n<p>The other running backs do catch passes, but Kamara should see a decrease in rushing volume with former Lions TD maker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980453/jamaal-williams\">Jamaal Williams</a> (17 TDs!) and TCU rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4599739/kendre-miller\">Kendre Miller</a> (third-round pick) joining the team. Kamara will also <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/38134765/fantasy-football-nfl-alvin-kamara-suspension-saints\">miss the first three games of the season while serving a suspension</a>.</p>\n<p>Swift is one of the Sanders replacements in Philadelphia, so he gets the elite offensive line but might find it difficult to amass volume with former Seahawk <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139925/rashaad-penny\">Rashaad Penny</a> and incumbent <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4371733/kenneth-gainwell\">Kenneth Gainwell</a> soundly in the mix. Penny has struggled to stay healthy, but so has Swift. A timeshare is good for the Eagles, who plan to play football deep into January, but not so much for fantasy managers.</p>\n<p>Montgomery joins the Lions to likely handle the Williams role as touchdown maker after four pseudo-productive seasons with the Bears, where he was generally a flex option for fantasy. However, the Lions drafted <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429795/jahmyr-gibbs\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a> in the first round, and there is no need for them to be patient with his volume. Montgomery might struggle to find volume of his own.</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<h2>Rookie wide receivers</h2>\n<p>Four wide receivers were picked consecutively in first round of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft/rounds\">the NFL draft</a>: <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430878/jaxon-smith-njigba\">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</a></b> (Seahawks), <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429025/quentin-johnston\">Quentin Johnston</a></b> (Chargers), <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429615/zay-flowers\">Zay Flowers</a></b> (Ravens) and <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429205/jordan-addison\">Jordan Addison</a></b> (Vikings). Each was an outstanding college player, and gets to play with a solid, veteran quarterback. Still, look at history as a guide. The Jets' <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a> and Saints' <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361370/chris-olave\">Chris Olave</a> played well, but they finished as WR3 choices. Relying on a rookie receiver as a potential flex option is often a mistake. The Vikings' <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a> is an exception, not a rule.</p>\n<h2>Receivers with questionable QBs</h2>\n<p>Buccaneers star <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans\">Mike Evans</a></b> is the obvious one, as whomever wins the starting job is a far cry from retired Hall of Famer Tom Brady. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116165/chris-godwin\">Chris Godwin</a> is the safer Tampa Bay WR option for fantasy. Meanwhile, we don't know who starts under center for the 49ers, making <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126486/deebo-samuel\">Deebo Samuel</a></b> a risk. He was already a risk because of missed games and far fewer carries after Christian McCaffrey joined the team. Former Panther <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\">DJ Moore</a></b> joins the Bears, a team that was last in the league in pass attempts. Former Cardinal/Texan <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins\">DeAndre Hopkins</a></b> has been limited by injury and suspension the past two seasons, and now gets <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill\">Ryan Tannehill</a> as his QB. Good luck.</p>\n<h2>Old, broken-down wide receivers</h2>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Fantasy managers continue to be fooled by Saints veteran <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas\">Michael Thomas</a></b>, who has played in only 10 games the past three seasons because of a variety of injuries and surgeries. His MVP campaign from 2019 is a long time ago. Similarly, the Ravens might believe <b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr\">Odell Beckham Jr</a>.</b> can recapture his once-legendary form, but his last WR2 season came in 2016 and his new QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> is hardly known for his throwing. Taking Thomas or Beckham in the first 10 rounds is a mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>This week <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> made headlines with a massive restructuring of his contract.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a>' signal-caller opted to reduce his salary by $35 million over the next two seasons, helping to give his new team a better chance at constructing a competitive roster.</p>\n<p>Though Rodgers' new deal drew headlines for its size and potential implications on the next chapter of his highly decorated career, it's not the first time such a restructuring has occurred.</p>\n<p>In fact, star quarterbacks and teams agreeing on mutually beneficial contract restructuring has become quite common over the last several years.

Per Spotrac, since 2012 Brady had almost as many contract re-structures as Super Bowl victories. Re-doing his deal twice with the Patriots and once with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, Brady's willingness to negotiate on active contracts freed up millions in cap space for his teams over the course of his lengthy career.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<h2><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/no.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" width=\"31\">Drew Brees</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints\">New Orleans Saints</a></strong></p>\n<p>Playing 20 years in the NFL, and 15 with the Saints, Brees developed a reputation as a consummate professional. One of his final acts with the team reflected that reputation -- a pre-retirement contract restructuring that saved the Saints nearly $24 million in cap space ahead of the 2021 offseason. It was a valuable parting gift -- as New Orleans was in dire cap straits at the time of the deal.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" width=\"31\"><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a></h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a></strong></p>\n<p>Mahomes has consistently made clear throughout his career that he's willing to sacrifice extra cash on his contract in order to allow a better team to be built around him. Mahomes' 2021 restructuring freed up $17.3 million in cap space, helping the Chiefs lay the foundation for their 2022 Super Bowl run. Ahead of the 2023 season, Mahomes restructured his deal again, saving Kansas City $9.6 million in cap space.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n<h2><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/dal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" width=\"31\"><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a></h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Cowboys have been trying to find the right formula to win a championship behind Prescott's arm for years now, an effort that's been aided plenty by Prescott off the field. The seven-year veteran has now re-structured his contract three times in the last three years -- saving Dallas a combined roughly $41 million in cap space in the process. Prescott's latest restructure was the biggest, clearing $22 million worth of cap in March.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cle.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" width=\"31\"><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a></h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns</a></strong></p>\n<p>No player in the NFL is owed more <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34096853/highest-paid-nfl-players-tracking-most-money-guaranteed-per-year-every-position\">guaranteed money</a> than Watson, but he and the Browns came to an agreement over the offseason to restructure his titanic deal to better situate the team for free agency. The Browns struggled last season, and Watson's return from suspension didn't rejuvenate the squad either (Cleveland went 3-3 over its final six games). Watson's new deal saved his team over $35 million in cap space to go towards a retooled 2023 squad.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n<h2><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/buf.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" width=\"31\"><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17102/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a></h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a></strong></p>\n<p>Allen's emergence has coincided with the Bills turning from also-rans in the AFC East to top contenders on a yearly basis, but Buffalo is yet to reach the Super Bowl with their new star signal-caller.

  "<p>ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- Eight NFL franchises have won back-to-back Super Bowl championships but none since the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a> did it following the 2003 and 2004 seasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> said the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> are focused on ending that streak and winning their second consecutive title.</p>\n<p>\"Everybody's motivated by that,'' Mahomes said Tuesday as he reported for training camp at Missouri Western State University. The Chiefs begin a three-day camp for quarterbacks and rookies Wednesday with full-squad practice starting Sunday.</p>\n<p>\"You should be motivated to do it again. When you have that parade, when you go through the offseason that I've been through, you want to do it again,\" Mahomes said. \"You only get those opportunities by winning the Super Bowl. And so for us, we want to make sure that we can build up and try to win that Super Bowl again because that moment, that feeling is something that you just wanted to grab every single time that you get the opportunity to do it.''</p>\n<p><alsosee> </p>\n<p>The Chiefs beat the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in February in Super Bowl LVII. They also won Super Bowl LIV over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a> in 2020, but failed to repeat as champions by losing to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> in Super Bowl LV. Mahomes said the Chiefs coasted into the playoffs in that 2020 season after winning 14 of their first 15 games.</p>\n<p>\"This time I think I'm going to try to really push and motivate guys to continue to try to get better even though we're winning football games,'' Mahomes said. \"Let's not be satisfied with just winning [but also] finding ways to get better every single week.</p>\n<p>\"Whenever you get that opportunity, you don't let it squander. You really take advantage of it and it's hard. I think it's going to be the hardest it's ever been. ... When you look at the AFC, there's almost every team you can see a path for them getting to the playoffs. I know I said that every year, but I think this year is real. We know week in and week out it's going to be a challenge for us and let's get better and try to win as many football games as possible and put ourselves in that position.''</p>\n<p>Mahomes said he was eager to test the ankle that he injured during the Chiefs' divisional round playoff win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> and that bothered him through the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>\"It feels great,'' he said. \"I think even going into [offseason practice], I still was a little timid about running and cutting and doing stuff like that, but when I got closer to minicamp and that later OTA stage, I got that confidence back in my ankle.</p>\n<p>\"I'll make sure that it's ready to go and I think I'm in a good spot with it.''</p>\n<p>Coach Andy Reid said the Chiefs would soon decide whether running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361529/isiah-pacheco\">Isiah Pacheco</a> will begin camp on the injured list or be able to participate. Pacheco, who led the Chiefs in rushing last season as a rookie and ran for 76 yards and a touchdown in the Super Bowl, had surgery during the offseason for hand and shoulder injuries.</p>\n<p>Regarding Pacheco's availability for the start of the regular season, Reid said, \"I think we'll have enough time, but let's see how this all goes.''</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p><strong>ONE MORNING IN</strong> the winter of 2005, RJ Caswell finds a 17-year-old senior between classes in the hallway of Charlotte Christian High School in North Carolina. Caswell, in his early 30s and known throughout the school as the only staffer to wear a bow tie every day, is in his first year coaching the varsity team after two years coaching in middle school, and he needs help. The new team he's taking over was decimated by graduation and is now composed of five freshmen. Caswell has never spoken to the senior before, but the player's fame precedes him.</p>\n<p>Caldwell approaches the son of an NBA All-Star guard with a humble request.</p>\n<p>\"Would you play for us?\" Caswell asks.</p>\n<p>He possesses raw talent, the coach believes, and if the young player continues working, he could certainly excel in the college ranks.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter, a skinny teenager named <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a> becomes the best player on the Charlotte Christian High School ... <i>golf team</i>.</p>\n<p>After leading his high school golf team, where he'd won a conference tournament and became known for massive drives off the tee, Curry's legend would only grow. He would play with celebrities such as Tom Brady and Michael Jordan and even former President Barack Obama. He would play at events featuring PGA stars and, as a scratch golfer, more than hold his own. That success, of course, would pale in comparison to a Hall of Fame NBA career headlined by two MVPs, four titles with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> and more 3-pointers than any player in history (3,390).</p>\n<p>Still, along the way, something else happened: A coterie started to form. It would be loaded with other great 3-point shooters, some of whom were among the game's all-time best.</p>\n<p>Naturally, Curry would notice. They all would.</p>\n<p>\"It feels like every good shooter that I know enjoys golf as well,\" Kyle Korver, an avid golfer and No. 5 on the NBA's all-time list for made 3-pointers, tells ESPN.</p>\n<p>Some picked it up early, others mid-career, others still after retiring, expanding this elite and exclusive group.</p>\n<p>The question is why.</p>\n<p>\"It's No. 2 on my priority list in my life outside of my family -- my obsession,\" says JJ Redick, an ESPN analyst and 18th on the all-time NBA 3-point list with 1,950 makes.</p>\n<p>\"I was playing every day,\" former NBA guard J.R. Smith, who sits right behind Redick at 19th on that all-time list with 1,930 3-point makes, tells ESPN. \"When I picked it up, I was playing before games. I was playing before practice. I had the bug immediately.\"</p>\n<p>Then there's Ray Allen, No. 2 on the all-time 3-point list with 2,973, who, like Redick, calls golf his \"obsession\" and says, \"in many ways, it saved my life.\"</p>\n<p>Leading this pack of elite shooters turned golf aficionados is Curry, who, on Thursday, will team up with fellow Warriors long-range ace <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6475/klay-thompson\">Klay Thompson</a> to play against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> teammates <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> in a charity golf event -- <a href=\"https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/latest/2023/06/22/how-to-watch--patrick-mahomes-and-travis-kelce-vs--stephen-curry-and-klay-thompson,-capital-ones-the-match\">Capital One's The Match</a> -- at the Wynn Golf Club in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>The Splash Brothers pairing of Thompson and Curry stands as the greatest combo of 3-point snipers on the course, which begs the question: Why does golf attract so many of the NBA's top 3-point shooters? Why are they often so good at it? What's behind this bizarre link between sharpshooters on both the course and the court?</p>\n<p>Curry, when presented with the mystery one afternoon this past postseason, pauses. At first, he says he isn't sure. A moment later, the connections seem to emerge.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>REDICK IS WALKING</strong> 18 holes and carrying his own bag as he plays a round at The Bridge in Sag Harbor, New York. The weather is less than pleasant. It's a Monday morning in November 2022: The temperature hovers in the mid-40s, with 20 mile-per-hour winds.</p>\n<p>Redick, who has a 10 handicap, shoots in the mid-80s, wraps up around 2 p.m. As he drives away from the club on this too-brisk-for-golf afternoon, his mind doesn't leave the game, and he begins wondering about the architecture of the course itself.</p>\n<p><i>\"​​Why is that bunker in the middle of the fairway?\"</i> he asks himself about one hole in particular. <i>\"Everybody misses left on that fairway. Wouldn't it make more sense if there was a bunker on the left side of the fairway?\"</i></p>\n<p>Redick laughs at the absurdity. It wasn't always this way. He played a few rounds headed into his final NBA season in 2021, believing it might be a post-retirement activity. And now?</p>\n<p>\"I'm obsessive,\" he says.</p>\n<p>As for what golf unlocked in him? That's a subject Redick finds fascinating.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>​​\"You can't be a good shooter unless you're in love with the process and the routine,\" Redick says. \"And you can't be a good shooter unless you're mentally tough. And I think golf is the same way.\"</p>\n<p>To become a great shooter, he says, \"You have to become so obsessed, so diligent, and there's really no other way. You can have a natural, good golf swing, but it doesn't mean you're going to be a scratch golfer.\"</p>\n<p>Golf scratches a competitive itch, he says.</p>\n<p>\"It's inherently competitive, because you're playing against the course, you're playing against your own handicap, you're playing against the elements that day,\" Redick says.</p>\n<p>Redick also notes the visualization required in both sports to imagine different sorts of shots from different angles or under different conditions.</p>\n<p>Korver, for his part, began playing golf when he was young, as both of his grandfathers introduced the sport to him. (One tended to hook the ball, the other tended to slice: \"And I ended up with this super unconventional way-forward-pressing swing,\" Korver says with a laugh.) Korver, who is now an assistant GM for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks</a>, played from then on, including throughout his 17-year NBA career.</p>\n<p>\"There's a lot of similarities to shooting and playing golf,\" Korver says. \"Golf isn't just striking the ball. Basketball is not just pushing this thing off my hand. Golf is a full-body thing, shooting is a full-body thing, and it's learning how to connect your energy and your angles with tempo.\"</p>\n<p>Smith, who played for 16 NBA seasons and won two titles, came to golf much later -- in 2008, when he was playing for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>. Growing up, his brother, father and grandfather had played it, but golf, he says, just wasn't as appealing to him as basketball, football or baseball, where he idolized Michael Jordan, Deion Sanders and Ken Griffey Jr.</p>\n<p>\"Golf was never really cool,\" he tells ESPN.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>When he finally played, though, Smith took to it immediately. He soon regretted not playing earlier -- \"I'd be light-years better now,\" he says. Still, he's discovered deep correlations to shooting.</p>\n<p>\"So much of it is feel, touch, muscle memory, the ability to continuously repeat that motion, that swing,\" Smith says. \"And from different spots, different angles, shots. There's a rhythm, a sort of motion, and that's why I think it's a lot like jump-shooting, because there's so much fluidity and movement but yet it's still based on the structure of it all.</p>\n<p>\"That is one of the reasons why it translates, because I felt like I had so many different shots in my arsenal as a basketball player -- and then golf is just a game of shots, too.\"</p>\n<p>After retiring from the NBA, Smith enrolled at North Carolina A&T, a historically Black college and university (HBCU) in Greensboro, and joined its Division I golf team, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33807054/ex-nbaer-turned-college-golfer-jr-smith-named-north-carolina-academic-athlete-year\">where he thrived</a>. This year, he launched the \"Par 3 Podcast,\" which is centered on golf. And when he plays with other basketball players, he sees his theories in real time.</p>\n<p>\"The shooters who hit the golf ball,\" Smith says, \"it's so pure.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>FEW NBA PLAYERS</strong> in history have had a shot as pure as Allen. Fewer, still, were more committed to golf, a sport he picked up from a coach in college. Back then, he was 19 and a top-tier athlete who believed he could do everything -- that he was, as he says, \"invincible.\" Yet, as Allen watched his coach explain a backswing, he found it boring, slow, not entertaining.</p>\n<p>Then he was invited to a golf tournament. He stepped up to hit the ball and, \"the ball didn't go five feet in front of me,\" he said. \"It was the strangest thing for me, because it seems so simple.\"</p>\n<p>That challenge consumed him.</p>\n<p>\"I realized I couldn't do it, and then it became this obsession,\" he said. \"I had to figure out a way to get the ball in the air, because I'm like, <i>'It can't be that complicated. The ball is just sitting there. It's not moving. Why can't I hit it?'\"</i></p>\n<p>During his first five years in the NBA with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a>, Allen played as often as he could, often in foursomes and fivesomes with older men who taught him techniques and nuances. It also gave him a schedule.</p>\n<p>\"It gave me a regimen that kept me out of trouble,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Instead of staying out late at night, Allen would be in bed early.</p>\n<p>\"If I didn't play golf, then I kind of would have been aimless and doing God knows what?\" he said.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>With shooting, in particular, Allen found that if he was in a rut, it often wasn't physical but mental.</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes you're taking quick shots, sometimes the defense is good and you're pressing,\" he said. \"Sometimes when you're in a bad rap, you're off a little bit, you know that that system can't flow, and that's what golf can help you do: Just relax.'\"</p>\n<p>Allen says the parallels with shooting -- rhythm, mechanics, feel -- are real, though don't manifest immediately. That, like his legendary pregame routine, it all comes down to exact repetition.</p>\n<p>\"Great shooters know,\" he said, \"I got to shoot my free throw, and I got to be great at it. So you're going to get to the golf course early, just like you do in practice for basketball, and you're going to work on different shots that you know you need to work on.\"</p>\n<p>To Redick, for all the connections, golf, like a shooting slump, can still be especially maddening.</p>\n<p>\"There's so many different elements to [golf],\" he said. \"And I think, in some ways, a really good jump shot has those elements. I just think golf is way f---ing harder.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can hit a good shot in golf,\" Redick continues. \"And there's a f---ing bunker right there.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CURRY LEANS BACK</strong> in his chair just outside the Warriors' locker room at Chase Center, his arms folded, his head cocked to the side. He's still considering the connections between high-level 3-point shooting and high-level golf.</p>\n<p>His answer -- much like his drives off the tee -- is a long one. He begins by noting that both require excellent hand-eye coordination -- Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser says Curry has the \"best hand-eye coordination of anyone in the world -- but then Curry circles back to mechanics.</p>\n<p>\"It's the visualization part of being able to feel something and being able to duplicate it over and over,\" Curry tells ESPN. \"That's exactly what we do with our mechanics in terms of jump-shooting. You have to have the same release every ... single ... time. And that's a feel thing.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses, thinking about where he wants to go next, then resumes.</p>\n<p>\"When you teach it, it's like in order to hit it left, you have to swing right,\" Curry says. \"To hit it high, you've got to swing down. It's a weird dynamic of teaching the mechanics of it. But there's a <i>feel</i> portion of it -- when you get the club in your hand, you know you want to get that ball to do something. And you can kind of feel it.\"</p>\n<p>To describe Curry's golf game, just ask former Warriors swingman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2386/andre-iguodala\">Andre Iguodala</a>, who has played countless rounds with him.</p>\n<p>\"​​He's long [off the tee],\" Iguodala tells ESPN. \"His irons are money. He can shave it both ways. He's got a soft touch, good short game and he can roll it really well. He really has no flaws. He can be errant off the tee from time to time but Steph is just the epitome of a golfer that you're jealous of, because he's just so good.\"</p>\n<p>Says Warriors coach Steve Kerr: \"He's not just an athlete playing golf. He's a golfer.\"</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>So, after retiring from the NBA, would Curry turn to professional golf full-time?</p>\n<p>\"I know for sure I will not pursue a typical PGA card or whatever you want to call it,\" Curry says.</p>\n<p>Curry knows there's a template for ex-athletes trying to scratch a competitive itch. But he also knows how competitive he is, and how he might want to push it further, work harder and sacrifice even more time away from his family.</p>\n<p>\"It's a very time-intensive sport and to be very good at it and practice and what I heard these pros go through, it's different,\" Curry said. \"I don't know if I'm ready for all that.

But Payne notes that the similarities in its impact are many -- with Curry working on his long game (3-pointers on the court, driving at the range) or his short game (one-handed floaters vs. chip shots around the green).</p>\n<p>\"There's a lot of parallels in terms of how we work,\" Payne says.</p>\n<p>Curry isn't in the camp that believes skilled 3-point shooters are the only basketball players who can succeed at golf, but, thinking about it more, he cracks a smile.</p>\n<p>\"You get the non-shooters who get a golf club in their hand,\" Curry says with a laugh, \"it's not pretty.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Becoming a baseball owner made sense on several levels for the Chiefs' QB1. Not only was Mahomes -- who played baseball in college -- a legitimate pro prospect, his father, Pat Mahomes, spent 11 seasons in Major League Baseball.

The deal has turned out to be pretty lucrative for James -- his original stake in the club, valued at about $6.5 million, had grown to about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23389022/liverpool-advancing-uefa-champions-league-final-financial-boon-lebron-james\">$32 million as of 2018.</a> In 2019, Liverpool won the Premier League for their first top-flight league title in thirty years.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr style=\"width:50%;\">\n\n\n<h3>James Harden -- Houston Dynamo, Houston Dash</h3>\n<p><photo13></p>\n<p>James Harden might not be in Houston anymore, but the former Rockets superstar's presence is still felt in the city.

Wilson, along with his wife, musician Ciara, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/seattle-sounders-fc/story/3919974/seahawks-qb-wilson-joins-sounders-ownership\">purchased a stake</a> in the team in 2019 -- just in time for them to win an MLS Cup title.

At the time, the price shattered the mark for a sports franchise. Magic kept it real at the time of purchase when explaining his role in recruiting free agents, saying that while he can't talk hitting or pitching with players, he \"can talk winning.\" If recent history is any indication (in case you blacked out all of 2020 -- the Dodgers won the World Series), it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

In recent years, quarterbacks have become the Madden Cover Man, including this year with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>.</p>\n<p>And in recent years, one quarterback has been above them all in Madden: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>. Mahomes is a member of the 99 Club for the third time in the past four seasons and the top quarterback for the fourth time in the past five years.</p>\n<p>He's twice been the cover athlete - once solo, once sharing it with Tom Brady - and is one of the most recognizable faces in the NFL. So the quarterback position in Madden starts with Mahomes, the defending Super Bowl MVP.</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3139477.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> (99 overall):</strong> Mahomes regains the top spot after losing it to Tom Brady last season (Mahomes was third and a 95 overall). His throwing power (97) is second-best to Allen, his throw under pressure is No. 1 (97) and he's second in all three throwing accuracy categories: Deep (91), medium (93) and short (98). Mahomes went up two in deep and medium accuracy from last season and three in short accuracy. By the time his career is over, Mahomes might have the most 99 Club honors in league history.</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3915511.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> (95 overall):</strong> Perhaps the gap shouldn't be as big between Mahomes and Burrow, but it is for now and is a reflection of just how good Mahomes is. Burrow jumps from fifth and a 90 rating to second and a 95. He is the game's most accurate thrower, tops in deep (93), medium (98) and short (99), jumps of seven, one and two, respectively, from last year's ratings. His throw under pressure (94) is second to Mahomes.</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3918298.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> (94 overall):</strong> It's the highest rating in the game for Allen, who told ESPN in June he hoped he would be higher than his 92 and No. 4 standing from last season. Allen has the game's most throwing power (99), becoming an annual tradition. He's tied for eighth among quarterbacks in speed (88) with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones\">Daniel Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239086/desmond-ridder\">Desmond Ridder</a>.

His throwing power is tied for eighth (93) and his throw under pressure is tied for fifth (89). In terms of accuracy, medium accuracy is the only place he's in the Top 10, and he's 10th at 86.

Hurts' breakout season, culminating in a Pro Bowl and throwing for 3,701 yards, 22 touchdowns and six interceptions along with 760 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns moved him well into the Top 10. Hurts is seventh in speed (89), tied with Jackson for fifth in throw under pressure (89), tied for eighth in deep accuracy (87), ninth in medium accuracy (87) and fifth in short accuracy (94).

Rodgers, a former 99 Club member who was rated in the Top 3 in Madden the past two seasons, received his lowest rating since he was an 86 in Madden '10. That was Rodgers' second year as a starter and he made his first Pro Bowl in the 2009 season. The ratings mirror where Rodgers ended last season, as an 86 overall. His throw under pressure is fourth (90), throw power is tied for eighth with Jackson and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a> (93), 10th in deep accuracy (86), tied for sixth with Allen in medium accuracy (89) and tied with Allen for seventh in short accuracy (92).</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/14880.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Minnesota Vikings</a> (84 overall):</strong> Cousins enters the Top 10 mostly due to his accuracy. A career 66.8% passer, he completed 65.9% of his passes last season, but is rated No. 3 in deep accuracy (90) and No. 4 in medium accuracy (91). Cousins threw for the second-most yards of his career (4,547) last season and also his most interceptions (14).</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4241479.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> (83 overall):</strong> Tagovailoa, despite the serious concussion injuries, had the best season of his career in 2022, throwing for 3,548 yards, 25 touchdowns and eight interceptions. That helped jump his rating up from a 75 to an 83. Last year, he and his backup, Bridgewater, were both rated 75s.

His ratings, though, are slipping a little. He's now tied for first in man coverage (97) after being a 98 last year and he's no longer tops in zone coverage (95) after being a 99 in zone the last two seasons. These are still small things for Ramsey, who is tied for third in catching (81) and play recognition (94).</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3895429.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895429/jaire-alexander\">Jaire Alexander</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Green Bay Packers</a> (95 overall):</strong> Alexander is second to Ramsey for the second straight year and is one of the dynamic corners in the game.

He was a Pro Bowler and first-team All-Pro last season after two interceptions and 10 passes defended. His play recognition is tied with Ramsey for third (94), his man coverage is tied with Alexander for third (96) and he's tied for fourth in zone coverage (93).</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4427250.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>T-4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427250/sauce-gardner\">Sauce Gardner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> (93 overall):</strong> Rookies very rarely make a Top 10 list. It's even hard for second-year players to do, which speaks to the impact Gardner had as a rookie, where he had two interceptions and 20 passes defended. The Defensive Rookie of the Year is tied with Ramsey for first in man coverage (97), sixth in zone coverage (92) and tied for fifth in play recognition with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126356/marlon-humphrey\">Marlon Humphrey</a> (93).</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3126356.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>T-4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126356/marlon-humphrey\">Marlon Humphrey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> (93 overall):</strong> Humphrey made his third Pro Bowl last season and tied a career high with three interceptions.

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>A player's age and experience can have a big say in his prospects for fantasy success.</p>\n<p>As we gain experience playing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/\">fantasy football</a>, we become increasingly familiar with player aging curves and their effects on statistical output. This knowledge can be helpful, as knowing performance patterns can guide you toward making better draft decisions, trade proposals and in-season pickups. At the same time, this knowledge can be a pitfall, as today's assumptions about player aging curves might not remain tomorrow's truths, and worse, even the best of us can fall prey to gimmicky claims about player aging trends.</p>\n<p><inline1>Surely if you've played this game for any amount of time, you've heard the theory that running backs fall off a statistical cliff once they celebrate their 30th birthday? Or perhaps you've been told that wide receivers' breakthrough seasons happen during their third year?</p>\n<p>This isn't meant to declare either theory utterly wrong. The point is that we should be constantly evaluating, revisiting and revising player aging curves to ensure that these trends haven't shifted, and we should bear in mind that no age-related label is \"one size fits all.\" After all, the game has changed significantly in recent seasons -- it's notoriously more protective of its quarterbacks nowadays and therefore a far more pass-oriented league than it was 15 years ago. Plus, it has seen an uptick in quarterback mobility over the past half-decade or so -- so it stands to reason that player aging trends would transform with the times.</p>\n<p>To get a sense of where we're at today, I collected data for the top 100 players who have debuted since the merger (1970 season) at each of the four skill positions, as well as the top 25 at each position to debut since 2000 and 2010, then analyzed them based upon both their ages in the given season as well as their years of experience in the league. The purpose of these sample sizes is to select the effective fantasy football elite, who these takeaways are the most valuable for. Here are the key takeaways in their order of significance in my opinion.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Tight ends enjoy a <i>huge</i> spike in NFL Year No. 2</h2>\n<p><b>Notable second-year tight end breakthroughs:</b> Antonio Gates (2004), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13232/jimmy-graham\">Jimmy Graham</a> (2011), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13229/rob-gronkowski\">Rob Gronkowski</a> (2011), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> (2014), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3040151/george-kittle\">George Kittle</a> (2018)</p>\n<p><b>Notable 2023 second-year tight ends:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4367209/greg-dulcich\">Greg Dulcich</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361050/isaiah-likely\">Isaiah Likely</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361307/trey-mcbride\">Trey McBride</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360635/chigoziem-okonkwo\">Chigoziem Okonkwo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241410/jelani-woods\">Jelani Woods</a></p>\n<p>There is no greater pattern of year-over-year growth -- across any of the four skill positions, three data subsets (since the merger, 2020 or 2010), regardless of trends by age or years in the league -- than second-year tight ends. Among those who debuted since 2000, sophomore tight ends experienced a 98.5% increase in PPR fantasy points per game compared to their rookie-season output. The group then maintained that average through their seventh NFL season and didn't experience significant statistical decline until around 30 years old.</p>\n<p>It's a logical finding, considering both the learning curve involved at the position at the NFL level and the differing ways in which the position is often utilized by college teams. Many college tight ends enter the NFL enter as either experienced receivers with limited blocking skills, or elite blockers without much future as pass-catchers, and NFL teams need both from the position. That's why <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360248/kyle-pitts\">Kyle Pitts</a> was one of the most unusual rookie tight ends, because of his strength in both. Of course, Pitts was one of the most disappointing second-year tight ends in history last season as his per-game production declined by 2.8 PPR fantasy points. But he has one of the most particularly unusual early-career stories we've seem.</p>\n<p>Any of the five second-year tight ends above could benefit similarly from their rookie-year experience. Dulcich and Woods are two who fit the \"have the receiving chops but didn't initially have the blocking\" description, and it could mean either is ready to take a big step forward in 2023.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Running backs decline sharply at age 29, sometimes sooner</h2>\n<p><b>Notable age 28 or 29 downturns:</b> Shaun Alexander (2005, age 29), Arian Foster (2015, age 29), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117846/chris-johnson\">Chris Johnson</a> (2014, age 29), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10456/marshawn-lynch\">Marshawn Lynch</a> (2015, age 29), Deuce McAllister (2007, age 29)</p>\n<p><b>Notable 2023 age-28 running backs:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045147/james-conner\">James Conner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116593/dalvin-cook\">Dalvin Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3068267/austin-ekeler\">Austin Ekeler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051392/ezekiel-elliott\">Ezekiel Elliott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042519/aaron-jones\">Aaron Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054850/alvin-kamara\">Alvin Kamara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980453/jamaal-williams\">Jamaal Williams</a></p>\n<p><b>Notable 2023 age-29 running back:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043078/derrick-henry\">Derrick Henry</a></p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>Though the statistical trend is less dramatic than the former entry, <i>this</i> might be the most important new lesson for fantasy managers. Running backs seem to be sharply declining sooner than their 30th birthdays.</p>\n<p>Among those who debuted since 2000, running backs experienced a 25.2% decline in PPR points per game, and 37.0% in total PPR points scored, from their age-28 to age-29 seasons. Only 11 running backs have reached their age-28 and 29 seasons since 2010 and the group saw a 16.8% decline in PPR points per game going from ages 26 to 27, 8.4% decline going from 27 to 28 and a 15.3% decline going from 28 to 29.</p>\n<p>In fact, running backs are getting fewer opportunities as they advance toward 30 years old. Last season, only 13.8% of all touches by running backs were accrued by those 28 or older, while 8.4% came from those 29 or older. That's a marked downturn from the 16.4% and 13.7% numbers that were accrued by those same groups 10 seasons earlier (in 2012).</p>\n<p><i>Opportunity</i> has had something to do with the shrinking length of running backs' careers, as has the extent of these players' workloads in their younger days. The NFL's shift to a thrift store approach to running backs has been well documented. There have been only 14 RBs selected in the first round of the NFL draft over the past 10 seasons (from 2014 to 2023), after 27 RBs were selected in the 10 drafts prior to 2013 and 31 in the 10 prior to 2003. There is less incentive for teams to invest in aging running backs, considering their potentially heightened cost. Dalvin Cook's release in early June was a good example of this, as he would have been paid more than $14 million in each of the next three seasons but has 1,503 career touches, 83% of which have come in just the past four years.</p>\n<p><inline2>This is why some of the names above warrant extreme caution in keeper and dynasty leagues. In addition to the wear-and-tear factor for <i>this</i> season, they're in extreme need of producing in 2023 in order to assure a similar role entering 2024. Ekeler specifically might be in the toughest position. He possesses the raw ability to perform beyond this his age-28, season, but is headed for free agency at year's end. He's a surefire first rounder for redraft leagues, but this might be the last great opportunity to trade him in a dynasty or keeper setup.</p>\n<p>Henry, meanwhile, enters 2023 as a high risk/reward pick. He has the third-most career touches among running backs (1,877), led the league in carries three of the past four years and missed nine games to conclude 2021 because of a foot fracture.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>QBs see their scrambling ability decline between ages 27 and 29</h2>\n<p><b>Notable ages 27-29 downturns:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16728/teddy-bridgewater\">Teddy Bridgewater</a> (2021, age 28), Colin Kaepernick (2015, age 27), Cam Newton (2016, age 27, and 2018, age 29), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a> (2016, age 27, and 2018, age 29)</p>\n<p><b>Notable 2023 ages 27 to 29 mobile quarterbacks:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> (27), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> (28), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a> (28)</p>\n<p>This isn't a hard-and-fast rule, as it can be impacted by the quarterback's specific workload at earlier ages, but it's notable that, among those who debuted since 2000, 27-year-old quarterbacks saw a 25.7% decline in their rushing fantasy production compared to their age-26 season. Additionally, the position's per-game rushing production in the age-27, 28 and 29 seasons was within 0.23 points of each other, signaling a clear plateauing of the group's scrambling skills. The group that debuted since 2010 exhibited similar, albeit not quite as extreme, decline as 27-year-olds (14.2%) while ranging within 0.13 points per game from ages 27-29.</p>\n<p>This isn't to suggest that Allen, Mahomes or Watson is destined for a steep decline in rushing ability, especially not as Allen and Mahomes both scored the most fantasy points on rushing plays in a single season in their careers in 2022.  It's more cautionary angle as there <i>will</i> come a point when each slows a bit and ultimately attempts fewer rushes. Understand that when you're drafting a mobile quarterback, you want to be targeting those who are younger, typically between the ages of 23 and 25.

Five of the six second-year breakthrough wide receivers above were selected in either the first or second round of the NFL draft, and the sixth (Marshall) was a fourth-round pick, underscoring the raw talent seen in them at the time of their NFL arrival.  Therefore, it's foolish to write off a wide receiver who disappointed in his rookie season.</p>\n<p>This is why <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361370/chris-olave\">Chris Olave</a>, who broke out to a decent extent with 198.2 PPR points last season, is such a compelling candidate to take a big step forward in 2023, especially with a stronger-armed quarterback in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a> throwing to him.

The star wide receiver was traded to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> and signed a four-year, $120 million extension, including $72.2 million guaranteed.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"When I saw Tyreek go and get 30 [million] a year, in the back of my head, I was like, man, that's two to three times what I'm making right now,\" he told Vanity Fair. \"I'm like, the free market looks like fun until you go somewhere, and you don't win. I love winning. I love the situation I'm in.\"</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have won two of the past four Super Bowls, including earlier this year when they defeated the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> 38-35 in Super Bowl LVII.</p>\n<p>Kelce, 33, is scheduled to make a base salary of $11.25 million this season, ranked 52nd among NFL players, according to the Roster Management System.

He has posted seven straight seasons of more than 1,000 yards -- a record for NFL tight ends -- and last season led the Chiefs in both receptions (110) and receiving yards (1,338). </p>\n<p>As such, he admits he does think about his contract situation.</p>\n<p>\"You see how much more money you could be making and, yeah, it hits you in the gut a little bit.

But I know I enjoy coming to that building every single day.\"</p>\n<p>Kelce also could just be following the example set by star quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, who will make a base salary of $5.5 million this season, according to the Roster Management System.

With Drew Brees and Tom Brady retiring in back-to-back years and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> not far behind, six of the top seven quarterbacks in the NFL are 27 years old or younger. They all are armed with $200 million-plus contracts -- or could be in the next three months. And they are all dual threats to varying degrees, effectively putting the traditional \"statue\" pocket passer to rest.</p>\n<p>While last year's rankings showed a depth problem at the position, the emergence of two young quarterbacks debuting in the top 10 and several veterans improving their play in 2022 has strengthened the pool. This made for a highly competitive voting process, especially for the 10th spot.</p>\n<p>Let's look at some of the game's top QBs as ranked by execs, coaches, scouts and players around the NFL.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3139477.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a></h2>\n<strong>Highest ranking:</strong> 1 | <strong>Lowest ranking:</strong> 2<br>\n<strong>Age</strong>: 27 | <strong>Last year's ranking</strong>: 2\n<p>Back on top after holding the No. 2 ranking last year, Mahomes received all but two first-place votes thanks to a dominant season capped by his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401438030\">second Super Bowl win</a>.</p>\n<p>\"He's got everything needed from a great quarterback, and he does those things at a high level all of the time,\" an AFC scout said.</p>\n<p>Most impressive was Mahomes' ability to adjust without the vertical threat of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>, who was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33578433/sources-miami-dolphins-acquire-kansas-city-chiefs-wr-tyreek-hill-five-draft-picks\">traded to Miami</a>. Of Mahomes' 41 touchdown passes, 31 went to running backs or tight ends, the most in a single season in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). Mahomes also led the postseason charge despite playing at less than full strength following a right ankle injury during the Chiefs' divisional round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>His QBR of 77.6 was six-plus points higher than that of any other quarterback. He was particularly dominant in the red zone, leading all quarterbacks with an 87.3 QBR. He's the best against the blitz, too (83.6 QBR).</p>\n<p>And he has proved efficient when the big passing yards aren't available. In the Super Bowl win over Philadelphia, Mahomes completed 12 passing first downs for 182 yards.</p>\n<p>\"He's accurate when uncomfortable, which is probably the hardest thing to do in the NFL,\" an NFL offensive coach said. \"The game just slows down to the point where he's at his best in the chaos.\"</p>\n<p>The Chiefs believe Mahomes improved his in-game adjustments in the past year, figuring out how defenses were attacking him and responding accordingly.

His 18 rushing touchdowns represent the most by a quarterback in a single season in NFL history.</p>\n<p>\"He's one of those guys who has progressively added to his game,\" an NFL personnel director said. \"Not really flappable, similar to Burrow in that sense. He remains calm. He can do all the things you need to from the pocket. I don't see why he can't be [a] precision passer. Look at all the games where he's had to dial it up from the pocket. He has that in his game.\"</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>To understand Hurts' growth as a thrower, look no further than the end of games. His fourth-quarter QBR of 84.3 ranked first in the league by a wide margin (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a> was No. 2 at 76.1). His 73.0 adjusted completion percentage (weighted by air yards, no throwaways/drops) ranked second.</p>\n<p>Hurts also led the NFL in completion percentage from inside the pocket (72.0) and threw for 10 touchdowns on passes of 25 yards or more.</p>\n<p>To be sure, he has a ton of help. Philly's offense is loaded. But that doesn't discount his impressive progress on the way to a Super Bowl berth.</p>\n<p>\"What I like about him is he knows he's got great receivers, so when he has a one-on-one, he throws it and doesn't hesitate,\" a veteran NFL offensive coach said. \"He might never be the kind of pinpoint accurate passer that Aaron Rodgers or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> is, but he's improving in that area.

The Super Bowl LIV win happened in the days before the COVID-19 pandemic, so there was no White House visit.</p>\n<p>They had a ring ceremony that year, but it was a socially distanced affair on the playing field at Arrowhead Stadium.</p>\n<p>\"I guess it is our first time going through it all, so it's all new to me and it feels right,\" tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> said. \"I think this is the last hurrah, though.

  "<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The most notable development of this week's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> minicamp was the absence of defensive tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones\">Chris Jones</a>. The Chiefs were planning for his arrival at training camp, whether that's for the start on July 23 or sometime later.</p>\n<p>\"It's part of the business,'' quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> said. \"I think Chris knows that we love him here. He's been a part of this team for a long time. He's one of the main reasons that we've had the success that we've had. He's been that leader on the defense. He's made a lot of big plays, and it seems like in the biggest moments, and you want those guys in your team.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure Chris is working, and he knows the defense that he needs to do, and the hope is that everything's good by training camp and we're able to come in and just roll and that's just part of it. And that's what makes this team ... so great is whenever guys that have to go handle their business, we let them handle it when they jump back in the building, and we get back to right where we left off.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Jones is headed into the final season of the four-year, $80 million contract he signed in 2020. The $20 million average makes him the eighth-highest-paid defensive tackle.</p>\n<p>Jones was tied for fourth in the NFL in sacks last season with 15.5, which tied his career high set in 2018. He also had two sacks in three postseason games. Asked about Jones' situation, coach Andy Reid initially said he was sure Jones would be there for camp. He later backed off, saying, \"I'm not sure about any of that. ... I wish I could predict that, but I think there's a chance [and a] chance he's not. We'll see.''</p>\n<p>Reid said he leaves the contract negotiations to general manager Brett Veach and the front office. As for what he has communicated recently to Jones, Reid said, \"'Make sure you're in shape.'\"</p>\n<p>Veach addressed Jones' situation prior to Thursday's ring ceremony. </p>\n<p>\"There's a lot of time before camp, so I feel good about where we're going to be with Chris,\" Veach said. \"I'm sure we'll have great dialogue now to start our training camp and look forward to Chris being here and not just for next year, but for a while. Do you have a timeline in your head where you feel comfortable getting stuff done? No, not really.</p>\n<p>\"We have a long history together and we have a great relationship with this to this day. So I mean these things usually worked out right before (training) camp, so we anticipate the same. We'll see how it goes.''</p>\n\n\n",
  "<p>CINCINNATI -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a> quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> wants to be at the top of the football world.</p>\n<p>Burrow has been in the conversation since turning the Bengals from a cellar dweller in the AFC North into a Super Bowl contender. But Burrow conceded that the top spot belongs to his biggest rival -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think there is any argument now, it's Pat,\" Burrow said Tuesday at the start of the team's mandatory three-day minicamp. \"Until somebody has a better year than he's had. He's the one to knock off.\"<br>\n<br>\n<alsosee></p>\n<p>The two quarterbacks have squared off in the AFC Championship Game in the past two postseasons. Burrow and the Bengals took Mahomes down in 2022 before Kansas City won the rematch in 2023 on its way to a victory in Super Bowl LVII.</p>\n<p>Mahomes had a massive year in helping Kansas City win its second Lombardi Trophy in the past four seasons. He led the NFL in Total QBR (77.6), passing yards (5,250) and touchdowns (41). Mahomes was named The Associated Press MVP, the second time he has won the honor.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most notably, he picked up his first win against the Burrow-led Bengals. Before Kansas City exacted revenge against the Bengals, Cincinnati had won three straight games against the AFC juggernaut.</p>\n<p>Last year was Burrow's best season in the NFL. He was an MVP finalist and named to his first Pro Bowl. He also threw a career-high, franchise record 35 touchdowns and finished 10th in Total QBR.</p>\n<p>But the Bengals fell short of going back to the Super Bowl one year after losing to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a> in the big game. On Tuesday, Burrow said winning the Super Bowl remains the objective.</p>\n<p>\"The goals never really change for me,\" said Burrow, the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft. \"They never really have. The top of the mountain is always the goal personally and team-wise. So even coming into the league, that was my goal. I wouldn't say that's changed year to year.\"</p>\n<p>Many of Burrow's teammates and coaches have stumped for him to be considered the game's best. That includes Bengals wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com.au/nfl/player/_/id/4362628/jamarr-chase\">Ja'Marr Chase</a>, who recently told NFL Communications that Burrow should be at the top of the list.</p>\n<p>Chase took it a step further when informed of Burrow's opinion as to who's the best in the game.</p>\n<p>\"Pat who?\" Chase said in a tongue-in-cheek response.</p>\n<p>But Burrow isn't concerned about where others slot him in the yearly offseason rankings as he tries to continue his ascent as one of the game's best quarterbacks.</p>\n<p>\"I know where I can get better,\" Burrow said. \"I know where I can improve just like everybody does. That's what I'm focused on throughout the offseason, throughout the year is incremental improvements to my game. You maintain discipline you'll get to where you want to.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>How many <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> players lining up in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/schedule\">2023</a> have a shot at being the best at their positions in league history?</p>\n<p>It's a complicated question. Even picking the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34302023/greatest-nfl-players-ever-every-offensive-position-picking-goat-quarterback-running-back-receiver-offensive-tackle\">greatest player in league history</a> at a given position is hard enough. The players with the best chance of chasing down the best at their positions typically are young and productive, which means we have to project a decade or even two into the future to estimate whether they have any realistic hope of making history.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is all subjective, so my feelings won't necessarily be in line with yours or anyone else's. I've leaned on cumulative production and measures of how players were seen in their time, such as first-team All-Pro appearances, with added bonuses for what they did in the postseason. Some observers might want to lean on the numbers and others might focus more heavily on playoff success. There's no right answer here.</p>\n<p>After taking a closer look, I found quite a few positions where there just wasn't anybody with a credible case to challenge the greatest player or players of all time. As good as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043078/derrick-henry\">Derrick Henry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a> are, there's no realistic path for them having a chance at supplanting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/Brown_Jim.html\">Jim Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/s/1999/1029/139775.html\">Walter Payton</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/72/emmitt-smith\">Emmitt Smith</a> to stand as the best running back in league history.</p>\n<p>Likewise, I didn't think there was a credible case for any current players at offensive tackle, center, off-ball linebacker, cornerback, safety, punter or punt returner. That isn't to say that players such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427250/sauce-gardner\">Sauce Gardner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242283/rashawn-slater\">Rashawn Slater</a> couldn't get there eventually, but they would need to string together a few dominant seasons to even have a viable path toward challenging the greats, let alone toppling them.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>In the end, I found seven active players who have a plausible chance of becoming the greatest of all time at their positions and two who, in my eyes, have already earned that nod. The seven who are on their way have varying amounts of work to do: One needs to make a couple of more All-Pro teams, while others must play at a superstar level for more than a decade to have any chance. </p>\n<p>I'll run through the players position-by-position and include projected chances for each to end their career as the best at their role.

Some of his numbers seem downright impossible to match: Will there ever be another quarterback, for example, who wins 20 division titles? Who wins an MVP award at 40? Who sets his career high for passing yards at age 44? Brady was blindingly consistent as a winner and, with all due respect to George Blanda, has been able to play at the highest level longer than any player in football history.</p>\n<p>For all of the debates, there's nobody really in Brady's league. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1428/peyton-manning\">Peyton Manning</a> finished with 16,000 fewer passing yards and won five fewer Super Bowls. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> has four MVP awards, one more than Brady, but he's more than 30,000 yards short of Brady and has only one Super Bowl title. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6445/joe-montana\">Joe Montana</a> has four rings and less than half as many passing yards.</p>\n<p>Passing yards and Super Bowl wins aren't the only way to judge a quarterback, but nobody can match Brady's résumé on either end, let alone top him in both categories.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3139477.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><b>Active player who could become the GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a></p>\n<p>If there's anybody out there who is off to a special start to his career, it has to be Mahomes, right? He already has two Super Bowl titles, three Super Bowl appearances and two regular-season MVP awards after just five seasons as a starter. Mahomes still hasn't played a single road game in the postseason, having dominated the AFC into landing one of the top two seeds in each of his five seasons. He has thrown for 24,241 yards through six years, and that number would be even higher if he hadn't sat behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8416/alex-smith\">Alex Smith</a> during his 2017 rookie campaign.</p>\n<p>Through six seasons, Mahomes is competitive with Brady, who sat out most of his rookie season in 2000 before famously being <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/32257032/the-hit-changed-tom-brady-drew-bledsoe-course-nfl-history\">forced into the lineup by an injury</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/393/drew-bledsoe\">Drew Bledsoe</a>. Brady had thrown for only 18,035 yards by the end of Year 6, but that was also in an era in which teams passed less often and with less efficiency than they do today. The difference is what Brady did in the postseason, as he started his career with three Super Bowl wins and finished this six-year stretch with a 9-0 postseason record.</p>\n<p><video1></p>\n<p>Of course, Brady still had <i>16 more seasons to go</i>. He lost a playoff game for the first time in 2006 and responded by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20274149/build-influence-legacy-2007-new-england-patriots-how-nearly-perfect-team-changed-nfl\" target=\"_new\">changing the NFL forever in 2007</a>, as the Pats adopted the spread offense and Brady produced one of the greatest seasons the league will ever see. He was a different player from that point forward; his interception rate dropped and his completion percentage spiked.</p>\n<p>Even if we throw out the first six years of Brady's career, the guy who showed up afterward threw for 67,650 yards and 502 touchdowns, won three MVP awards and took home four Super Bowl rings. That guy is a strong candidate for the greatest quarterback ever, although adding three <i>more</i> Super Bowls to the mix obviously helps.</p>\n<p><a name=\"wr\"></a></p>\n<p>Someone will eventually break Brady's passing yardage record, with Mahomes as the favorite. I don't think that will be enough to topple Brady as the ultimate quarterback. Mahomes will need to add more Super Bowls to the mix to catch up. Asking for him to top Brady and land eight might be unrealistic, but can he get into the ballpark? If Mahomes claims the passing record and wins, say, five Super Bowls, does that supplant Brady? Six titles? Mahomes is off to an incredible start, but there's still so much work to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Mahomes will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 15%</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Wide receiver</h2>\n<p><b>Current GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12/jerry-rice\">Jerry Rice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">49ers</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Raiders</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seahawks</a> (most receptions and receiving yards in NFL history, one of two players in history with 10 first-team All-Pro appearances)</p>\n<p>Unless you want to bring Don Hutson's career into the mix from the World War II era, I don't believe there will be many people arguing with Rice as the selection here. He finished his career with 22,895 receiving yards. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5528/larry-fitzgerald\">Larry Fitzgerald</a> is in second place, and he's more than 5,400 yards behind. Nobody else in league history has topped 16,000 receiving yards.</p>\n<p>If you judge greatness by pure value, Tom Brady would be the NFL's greatest player by virtue of playing quarterback. If you're judging it by how significantly a player outperformed his peers at his position, you could make a strong case for Rice.</p>\n<p>Rice is so far ahead of the pack as to eliminate virtually all competitors. There's no hope of receivers in the prime of their careers, such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs\">Stefon Diggs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>, catching up. Hill is probably a Hall of Famer and still just 29. If he follows in Rice's footsteps and plays until he's 42, he would need to average more than 1,000 yards for 14 more seasons to top Rice's totals. Getting 17 games and playing in a pass-happy era helps, but the chances of anybody staying at that level while remaining healthy into their 40s are remarkably slim.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4262921.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><b>Active player who could become the GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Vikings</a></p>\n<p>Instead, you have to look toward players at the beginning of their careers and hope they ride those advantages to glory. With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362628/ja'marr-chase\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> sidelined by injury for part of the 2022 season, Jefferson is the only player I'm comfortable putting out there as a candidate. The Vikings star has racked up 4,825 receiving yards across his first three seasons, the most of any player in NFL history by more than 600 yards.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>The top five in that category illuminate how difficult it will be for Jefferson to stay on Rice's trail. The others just behind Jefferson include <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1433/randy-moss\">Randy Moss</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr\">Odell Beckham Jr.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13983/aj-green\">A.J. Green</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas\">Michael Thomas</a>. (Rice ranks eighth.) Moss went off the boil during his time in Oakland before reigniting in New England, but he was done as an impact receiver after his age-32 season. Rice racked up 9,620 receiving yards <i>after</i> his age-32 campaign. Beckham and Thomas had their primes marred by injuries, while Green faded after his first five seasons.</p>\n<p>Jefferson has advantages. He'll get a 17th game and possibly an 18th game in seasons to come. He plays in a more pass-friendly era than Rice and spends a minimum of nine games per season indoors. Of course, he also has started his career with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> at quarterback and likely will be catching passes from a new signal-caller in 2024 given <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/37328520/vikings-qb-kirk-cousins-future-want-minnesota\">Cousins' uncertain future</a> in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>Jefferson, who will be playing his age-24 season in 2023, still has so much more work to do to stay aligned with Rice, let alone surpass the legendary wideout. After an Offensive Player of the Year season a year ago, he now has averaged 1,608 receiving yards a year. If things break right and he is somehow able to both stay healthy and keep up that level of production on an annual basis, he would need to sustain that level of play for 12 more seasons to beat Rice. If he slows down, he'll need to continue playing into his late 30s and possibly even into his 40s to chase down Rice.</p>\n<p><a name=\"te\"></a></p>\n<p>Somebody will eventually break Rice's record, but just about everything will have to go right for him to do so. And even then, given how pass rates have changed, there likely would still be a reasonable case for Rice as the greatest wideout who has ever lived.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Jefferson will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 1%</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Tight end</h2>\n<p><b>Current GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1231/tony-gonzalez\">Tony Gonzalez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Falcons</a> (leads all tight ends in receptions, receiving yards and first-team All-Pro appearances)</p>\n<p>I wrote all about this topic <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35235211/travis-kelce-chiefs-one-best-nfl-players-ever-why-unique-one-greatest-tight-ends-all#stand\" target=\"_new\">in December</a>, when Travis Kelce became the fifth tight end in league history to put up 10,000 receiving yards across his career.

Gonzalez amassed a staggering 15,127 receiving yards and 111 touchdowns during his 17-year career with the Chiefs and Falcons.</p>\n<p>Does Kelce have time to get there? Gonzalez entered the league as a 21-year-old. Kelce was drafted at 24 and played only one game as a rookie after undergoing microfracture surgery on a knee; his first significant season wasn't until his age-25 campaign. Gonzalez already had more than 3,000 receiving yards and 24 touchdowns by that point.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons to be optimistic about Kelce's chances. One is that he shares a rare trait with Gonzalez and Witten relative to other tight ends: health. Even great tight ends struggle to play full seasons without missing chunks of time. Gonzalez somehow missed just one game during his illustrious career. Kelce was sidelined for most of his rookie season, but he has missed three games over the ensuing nine seasons, and those were two weeks off for rest at the end of the year and a game in which he was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32939954/source-kansas-city-chiefs-te-travis-kelce-covid-19-protocol-vs-pittsburgh-steelers\">sidelined by the COVID-19 protocols</a> in 2020.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>The other reason is that Kelce already is breaking rules about tight ends aging. The age-33 season is usually a point of no return for even the best tight ends on the planet. Gonzalez's last 1,000-yard season came at age 32, and he topped 900 yards just once over his five remaining seasons. No tight end since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 had topped 1,000 receiving yards after turning 32 until Kelce did it last season.</p>\n<p><a name=\"og\"></a></p>\n<p>I'm not sure Kelce needs to top Gonzalez's totals to be recognized as the greatest tight end of all time, but if he comes close and has multiple Super Bowl rings on his résumé, that should make for a strong case.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Kelce will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 60%</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Guard</h2>\n<p><strong>Current GOAT:</strong> One of a few guards -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/170438/john-hannah\">John Hannah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/173/bruce-matthews\">Bruce Matthews</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/191/randall-mcdaniel\">Randall McDaniel</a> -- who were named first-team All-Pro seven times.</p>\n<p>The debate for best guard ever could probably be an article in itself; you can make a case for the three players above or a handful of others.

Versatility? Matthews is your man, having started at every single spot up front at one point or another during his 19-year pro career. Consistency? McDaniel made 12 consecutive Pro Bowls. Sheer dominance? You might opt for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/609/larry-allen\">Larry Allen</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuUgwgC33MY\">made the impossible look possible</a> and might have had the best physical attributes in league history at any position.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/16709.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><b>Active player who could become the GOAT: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16709/zack-martin\">Zack Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Cowboys</a></b></p>\n<p>For all we talk about the Cowboys, we don't often talk about their best player. Martin has been a model of consistency since entering the league, with an injury-hit 2020 season serving as the only time he hasn't made it to a Pro Bowl. Offensive line nominations for the Pro Bowl can be, shall we say, curious, but he also held up his own in making six first-team All-Pro appearances.</p>\n<p>Since Martin entered the league in 2014, the Cowboys have generated 0.07 expected points added (EPA) per play with him on the field and 0.01 EPA per play without him. For context, the Cowboys have played like the 2023 Bengals when Martin has been on the field and the 2023 Browns or Steelers when he has been unavailable or taking a breather. Some of that is not having quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a> on the field for most of that 2020 campaign, but you get the idea: Martin is a difference-maker.</p>\n<p><a name=\"er\"></a></p>\n<p>Right now, it feels like he's toward the bottom end of that logjam of candidates who might be considered among the greatest guards of all time. To get to the top, the 32-year-old Martin could start by adding two more first-team All-Pro appearances to his name, which would make him the first player in league history to earn that honor eight times as a guard. He also has failed to advance as far as the NFC Championship Game as a pro, so a deep playoff run or two wouldn't hurt his chances.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Martin will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 35%</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Edge rusher</h2>\n<p><b>Current GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6705/lawrence-taylor\">Lawrence Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">Giants</a> (three-time Defensive Player of the Year, NFL MVP, eight-time first-team All-Pro)</p>\n<p>Let's review the early-career résumé of the greatest defensive player of all time. In Year 1, Taylor won both the Defensive Rookie of the Year <i>and</i> Defensive Player of the Year awards while racking up 9.5 unofficial sacks for the Giants. (The sack wasn't an official statistic until 1982, but <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2021/07/pre-1982-sacks-added-to-pro-football-reference/\">Pro Football Reference</a> uses research from John Turney and Nick Webster to locate sacks through 1960.) New York's defense jumped from 27th in the league in points allowed per game to fourth, and the Giants went from 4-12 to 9-7.</p>\n<p>Taylor followed up with 7.5 sacks in the nine-game abbreviated season of 1982 and won his second straight Defensive Player of the Year award, giving him 17 (unofficial) sacks in 27 games.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4361423.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong><b>ctive player who could become the GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361423/micah-parsons\">Micah Parsons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Cowboys</a></p>\n<p>Since entering the league and undergoing the quickest transition in recent memory from inside linebacker to star pass-rusher, Parsons has drawn comparisons to Taylor. It has been only two seasons, of course, but Parsons is off to a spectacular start in Dallas.</p>\n<p>Parsons isn't yet at Taylor's level, but he isn't far off. Like Taylor, Parsons has been named a first-team All-Pro in each of his first two seasons. Parsons won Defensive Rookie of the Year in a unanimous vote in 2021. He has finished second in Defensive Player of the Year balloting in each of his first two seasons and has a combined 26.5 sacks across 33 games, putting him ahead of Taylor in one key metric for pass-rushers.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Taylor winning Defensive Player of the Year twice puts him ahead, and he has a historical element that Parsons won't be able to match. The perception of Taylor, both at the time and certainly in hindsight, is that <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016487.html\" target=\"_new\">he changed the game of football</a>. Parsons is an incredible talent, and spending time as a middle linebacker at school gave him a unique set of skills, but he rushed the quarterback on more than 81% of dropbacks last season, and that number is likely to rise in the years to come.</p>\n<p>I don't think Parsons will change the sport as we know it, which means he'll have to beat Taylor with accolades, numbers and playoff success. Parsons doesn't have a Defensive Player of the Year award on his mantel yet, but becoming the first defender in league history to take home four of them would be a good start. His 26.5 sacks place him <a href=\"https://stathead.com/tiny/8eOCr\" target=\"_new\">eighth on the unofficial all-time list</a> and sixth on the official list behind <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13988/aldon-smith\">Aldon Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/157/reggie-white\">Reggie White</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller\">Von Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/98/derrick-thomas\">Derrick Thomas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8427/shawne-merriman\">Shawne Merriman</a>.

Watt</a> narrowly missed out on this list after tearing his pectoral muscle last year as a 28-year-old. Bosa, who just won his first Defensive Player of the Year award for the 49ers, is a more imposing challenger to Taylor's throne. The only thing that has slowed down Bosa during his first four seasons was a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31511548/san-francisco-49ers-de-nick-bosa-acl-expected-ready-training-camp\">torn ACL</a>, which limited him to two games in 2020.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, Bosa has been devastating. He has racked up 43 sacks over his first four seasons, good enough for 17th on the official sack list over Years 1 through 4, even with what amounts to a lost season in the mix. He is the 10th player to win both Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, although Taylor pulled it off in the same season.</p>\n<p><a name=\"dt\"></a></p>\n<p>Like Parsons, Bosa has a long road ahead. Right now, he's averaging just over 14 sacks per 17 games. If he can keep that up for years to come, stay healthy and win a couple of Super Bowls along the way, he might have a shot at setting the league's sack record and matching up with LT.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Bosa will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 3%</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Defensive tackle</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/16716.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><b>Current GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald\">Aaron Donald</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Rams</a> (three-time Defensive Player of the Year)</p>\n<p>There's reasonable arguments for other legends on the interior. Bob Lilly and Randy White gave the Cowboys a Hall of Fame-caliber defensive tackle for a quarter of a century. Joe Greene was arguably the most devastating player on the Steel Curtain defense during Pittsburgh's dynasty in the 1970s. Merlin Olsen made it to 14 Pro Bowls in 15 years for the Rams from 1962 to 1975; the only player who earned a 15th Pro Bowl nod during his NFL career was Brady, who took 22 years to get there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34488139/aaron-donald-los-angeles-rams\">Donald's résumé</a>, though, might already beat them all. He is one of three players and the only defensive tackle to win the Defensive Player of the Year award three times, tying him with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6705/lawrence-taylor\">Lawrence Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13979\">J.J. Watt</a>. He missed seven games last season due to an ankle injury, ending a run of seven consecutive first-team All-Pro appearances. Nobody else at <em>any position</em> has done that since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>About the only hole you could poke in Donald's career was a relative lack of postseason success, but he played a key role in the victory over the Bengals in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326638\">Super Bowl LVI</a>. In my opinion, Donald or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller\">Von Miller</a> should have been named MVP -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33285438/cooper-kupp-named-mvp-super-bowl-lvi-late-td-lifts-los-angeles-rams-cincinnati-bengals\">not Cooper Kupp</a> -- for what they did to turn things around against Cincinnati in the second half of that game.</p>\n<p>Donald doesn't have quite the longevity of the other legends at his position, but he has been dominant for the entirety of his nine years as a pro. If he declines over the next couple of years and then retires, he'll already have done enough to secure his spot as the greatest defensive tackle ever. If he can add a fourth Defensive Player of the Year award to his résumé and win another Super Bowl, he might challenge Taylor to be considered the best defensive player at any position in league history. Of course, if you ask former teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey\">Jalen Ramsey</a>, Donald is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jalenramsey/status/1667223662015946769\" target=\"_new\">already there</a>.</p>\n<p><a name=\"pk\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Chances Donald will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 100%</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Kicker</h2>\n<p><b>Current GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1097/adam-vinatieri\">Adam Vinatieri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">Patriots</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Colts</a> (career leader in field goals made, playoff heroics)</p>\n<p>Some might opt for Morten Andersen or Lou Groza -- and Mark Moseley is the only full-time kicker to <a href=\"https://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-year-the-nfl-went-insane-and-gave-a-kicker-the-mvp-award/\">win an MVP award</a> -- but Vinatieri's résumé is hard to contest. His incredible staying power saw him spend 24 years in the league, eventually finishing with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31515894/adam-vinatieri-nfl-all-leading-scorer-retiring-24-nfl-seasons\">most successful field goal conversions</a> in league history.</p>\n<p>Vinatieri is also second on the extra point charts, but he's always going to be remembered best for his playoff heroics, most memorably the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/695025853911138304\">kicks he hit</a> to help propel the Patriots to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/220203017\">Super Bowl XXXVI title</a> in Brady's first season as a starter.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/15683.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><b>Active player who could become the GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15683/justin-tucker\">Justin Tucker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Ravens</a></p>\n<p>Tucker is clearly the greatest kicker of this generation. He's the first full-time kicker in league history to rack up five first-team All-Pro appearances and holds the record for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32286586/baltimore-ravens-tucker-wins-game-detroit-lions-record-66-yard-fg\">longest successful field goal</a> in league history. His 90.5% field goal percentage is the best mark for any kicker, but he's also kicking in an era in which success rates are higher than ever before. The six best kickers in league history in terms of field goal rate are <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/fg_perc_career.htm\" target=\"_new\">all active</a>. The top 70 in league history by that rate have all ended their careers in the 21st century.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>There are two things Tucker has to do to leave the game as the league's best-ever kicker without much debate. One is simple enough: keep going. He is about to begin his 12th NFL season, which will have him at the halfway point of Vinatieri's career. Tucker already has converted 365 field goals, leaving him on pace to top Vinatieri's record of 599, but projecting anybody to follow Vinatieri's lead and play until he's 47 years old is impossible.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Tucker will need to add to his résumé of memorable kicks in the postseason to compete with Vinatieri. Tucker won a Super Bowl in his rookie season and went 4-for-4 on field goals in the process, but while the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330203025\">Ravens beat the 49ers</a> by 3 points, Tucker's field goal put Baltimore up five before a late intentional safety.</p>\n<p><a name=\"kr\"></a></p>\n<p>Tucker has gone 11-for-15 on field goals in the playoffs since, including a 1-for-3 performance amid tough winds in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401220397\">frustrating loss to the Bills</a> at the end of the 2020 campaign. He has shown the ability to convert big kicks in the regular season, but despite the Ravens making regular trips to the postseason, the opportunity to hit memorable game winners hasn't really arisen. Give Tucker another dozen years in the league and he likely will build his playoff résumé, but it's going to be tough to compete with Vinatieri's heroics.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Tucker will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 30%</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Kick returner</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/15807.png&w=43&h=60&scale=crop&background=0xcccccc&transparent=false\"></p>\n<p><b>Current GOAT:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15807/cordarrelle-patterson\">Cordarrelle Patterson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Vikings</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Raiders</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">Patriots</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Bears</a>/<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Falcons</a> (nine kickoff returns for TDs)</p>\n<p>What, you thought I was going to forget about the returner? I believe Patterson already has established himself as the best kickoff returner in league history by becoming the first player to take nine kickoffs to the house. He had previously been in a tie with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9270/joshua-cribbs\">Josh Cribbs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9703/leon-washington\">Leon Washington</a>, each of whom have strong cases for being considered alongside the Falcons standout as the best ever.</p>\n<p>There are other players who have been even more impactful than Patterson in a smaller sample of returns. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12569/percy-harvin\">Percy Harvin</a> returned five kickoffs for touchdowns on just 152 tries, which is in line with Patterson's nine scores across 266 returns. Harvin's trump card, of course, is that he added a sixth in the biggest game of the 2013 season, as the Seahawks blew out the Broncos in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/340202007\">Super Bowl XLVIII</a>.</p>\n<p>Patterson is the most productive return man in history, but if you had to pick one player to go back and field a single kickoff in the hopes of landing a score, you might go with Gale Sayers. The legendary Bears running back fielded 91 kickoffs during his career and returned <i>six</i> for touchdowns, meaning he converted kickoffs into scores twice as often as Patterson. Around the same time, Packers and Rams back Travis Williams converted six of his 102 kickoff returns into touchdowns.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>I'd give the nod to Patterson, though, who has thrived in an era in which nobody else has even come close. He has scored all nine of his kickoff return touchdowns since the league shortened kickoffs in 2012. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10517/jacoby-jones\">Jacoby Jones</a> racked up four over that span, and no other player has more than three. Patterson also has averaged 29.5 yards per return in his career, more than any other player with at least 20 kick returns. He has been phenomenal and done so while scoring kickoff return touchdowns for four different organizations, including one for the Falcons in 2022.</p>\n<p>Patterson is the best kick returner in history. Is he the best <i>returner</i> in league history, full stop? No. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9643/devin-hester\">Devin Hester</a> has five kickoff returns for scores to go with his NFL-record <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21748013/all-return-td-leader-devin-hester-retiring-nfl\">14 punt return touchdowns</a>. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/55/eric-metcalf\">Eric Metcalf</a> is the only other returner to hit double-digit punt return scores. Hester and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2284/dante-hall\">Dante Hall</a> are the only return men with at least five punt <i>and</i> five kick return touchdowns. Patterson is not going to catch up to Hester, but one more kick return touchdown would put some breathing room between him and the rest of his competition.</p>\n<p><strong>Chances Patterson will end his career as the GOAT:</strong> 100%</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

He had a front-row seat as Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian orchestrated two contract extensions with Manning while also finding a way to field a Super Bowl-winning roster around his quarterback.</p>\n<p>Telesco didn't discard the binder when he became a first-time general manager for the Chargers in 2013, but he didn't reference it often, either.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"I didn't have it really thinking, 'I'm going to need this with another job.' I just thought this is stuff I really need to drill down on,\" Telesco said, adding, \"I didn't even think of pulling it out.\"</p>\n<p>Until he did.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>'s continued ascent and the impending explosion of the quarterback market, it became all but certain this past fall that the Chargers would enter negotiations with the 2020 sixth overall pick on a long-term extension when he became eligible after the season.</p>\n<p>\"I pulled it out, started flipping through it,\" Telesco said. \"And I'm like, thank God I have this.\"</p>\n<p>The binder is a manual on how to navigate a quarterback contract extension that will consume a significant portion of the salary cap, while also building a team capable of a deep playoff or Super Bowl run.</p>\n<p>\"Some of it doesn't apply anymore,\" Telesco said, noting the change in the rookie pay scale implemented in 2011 to provide consistency among salaries and address excessive paydays for new pros. \"But there's still some things in there that I've written down that I've learned that like, yeah, this definitely is going to apply.\"</p>\n<p>Telesco and the Chargers are among several NFL front offices navigating how to retain young franchise quarterbacks and simultaneously build a playoff-caliber team around them.

It's a very real situation,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seattle Seahawks</a> coach Pete Carroll said of reworking a roster around a significant quarterback extension. \"The dynamics of the structure of your roster shifts.</p>\n<p>\"You really have to be creative and you really have to be fortunate in mixing the makeup of the roster to make it work.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>TOM BRADY, WHO</strong> retired with seven Super Bowl rings, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, with two titles over the past four seasons, haven't just skewed expectations for quarterback play on the field.</p>\n<p>They've proved to be the outliers off it.</p>\n<p>Each signed what some have labeled \"team-friendly\" contracts. Brady's deal equated to less money, and Mahomes agreed to a deal that spread a then-record-breaking extension over a long period, in an effort to help manage the salary cap.</p>\n<p>So, how do you keep your quarterback financially content and build a team for long-term success?</p>\n<p>\"You've got to have a quarterback who understands the business and who's willing to ultimately have those conversations with his agent and us to find a deal that takes care of him, gives him the guarantees and the money he needs,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a> general manager Brandon Beane said.</p>\n<p>Brady, in 23 NFL seasons, didn't attract headlines with record-shattering contracts. He retired after the longest career in league history with $317 million in career earnings, according to Over the Cap, not including endorsement deals or the reported 10-year, $375 million contract he signed with Fox Sports to be a broadcaster in retirement.</p>\n<p>Stars naturally gravitated toward playing with Brady, but it didn't hurt when courting wide receiver Randy Moss in 2007 and signing cornerback Darrelle Revis in 2014 that Brady's contract helped allow for their deals.</p>\n<p>As he attempted to earn a seventh Super Bowl ring in Tampa, his first without the Patriots and coach Bill Belichick, Brady signed a two-year deal in 2020 with an average of $25 million per year guaranteed. </p>\n<p>\"Tom always took team-friendly deals to continue to surround himself with guys to help him win,\" Tennessee Titans general manager Ran Carthon said. \"So it's one of those things that is based on the organization and that person in that role to help you figure out how you're going to continue to build a team.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes and Kansas City agreed to an eye-popping $503 million deal after he led the Chiefs to a Super Bowl in 2020. The extension spans 10 years -- an unusual contract length by NFL standards.</p>\n<p>\"Some people, they might say he is underpaid,\" Carthon said about Mahomes, who averages $45 million per season. \"But you know, he has it figured out and it's cap-friendly and allows them to keep their guys and keep signing guys.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes' salary ranks seventh among the league's quarterbacks, but he said he wasn't concerned about money at Chiefs OTAs last week.</p>\n<p>\"Me, my agent and the team, always keep open communication and we try and do whatever is best for the team, but obviously I want to do the best for myself as well,\" Mahomes said. \"But at the same time, I want to -- I've always said I worry about legacy and winning rings more than making money at this moment.\"</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Chris Cabott, CEO of Equity Sports, represents Mahomes and several other NFL quarterbacks.</p>\n<p>In Cabott's experience, multiple factors come into play when executing a quarterback extension, including whether there is stability in ownership and coaching, along with a nucleus of players who can help a team to a Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>If those criteria aren't in place, a long-term extension -- like one that spans 10 seasons -- might not be best.</p>\n<p>But if they are?</p>\n<photo2>\n<p>\"You can have it all,\" Cabott said about the dynamic between a quarterback and team when negotiating an extension. \"You can have the big contract and you can keep winning. It just takes a lot of work and it takes a lot of trust and takes a lot of communication.</p>\n<p>\"You can't win the game by yourself, so you have to be diligent about everything around you, but that should never be at the mercy of the compensation or the guarantees.\"</p>\n<p>It wasn't long after Mahomes and the Chiefs struck their deal that Beane and quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> played a round of golf together and the conversation turned to contracts.</p>\n<p>\"He and I talked a little bit about the pros and cons of that [Mahomes] deal and just some broad strokes of it,\" Beane said. \"And we talked about Tom Brady and the championships he won, and so that's where it gets tough, because, yes, you want to be fairly compensated and it's not good for the team to get you on some deal that's not fair to you either because you're going to be unhappy and that doesn't work.\"</p>\n<p>A year after Mahomes' extension and on the heels of an AFC championship appearance, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31973651/buffalo-bills-qb-josh-allen-agree-6-year-253m-extension-150m-guaranteed\">Allen signed a six-year, $258 million contract.</a></p>\n<p>\"Josh was very adamant about -- 'I'll work with my people and yes I want to be recognized -- there's a respect thing -- but I also [want] to win and I want to be able to keep player X, player Y,'\" Beane said. \"Now, if I do that and then I don't back it up and I'm losing some of the guys that he thinks can help us win or we're going cheap now, we're probably going to have a problem.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>THERE ARGUABLY IS</strong> no task more difficult in the NFL than finding a franchise quarterback.</p>\n<p>\"If you've got a quarterback, you're excited,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Minnesota Vikings</a> coach Kevin O'Connell said. \"If you don't, you're excited to go find them.\"</p>\n<p>That alone gives quarterbacks leverage when negotiating an extension, because when a team has a good quarterback, let alone a great one who has made the playoffs and had success, he will command record-breaking money.</p>\n<p>It's known as the \"pay-me-or-else mentality,\" one AFC executive said. It dares the organization to attempt the alternative and find a new quarterback, knowing there's zero guarantee how that will turn out.</p>\n<p>Ask the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-commanders\">Washington Commanders</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Washington would not sign quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> to an extension after he played two seasons on the franchise tag. Cousins reached free agency and signed a three-year, fully guaranteed $84 million deal with the Vikings, who have made two playoff appearances with him since.</p>\n<inline2>\n<p>The Commanders, meanwhile, have been in search of a quarterback ever since -- starting 12 players at the position in four seasons, all void of a winning record.</p>\n<p>For the team, there is some pushback available: The most compelling way is to convince a quarterback he can achieve long-term success like Brady and Mahomes by taking a deal that, over time, will help him earn more by way of career success, longevity and endorsements.</p>\n<p>\"You got to know that there's some give-and-take that when you come across one of the great ones and you have to ultimately pay that high dollar number, you have to go along with the give-and-take of it,\" Carthon said. \"There are teams that have figured it out.\"</p>\n<p>But the question for many teams is getting the message to their quarterback, because agents oversee most contract negotiations, and their job is to get their client paid.</p>\n<p>It could be perceived, with each deal richer than the last regardless of results, that some agents are mostly out for the money and are less concerned about the team's ability to field a great product around their player.</p>\n<p>\"The agent just wants bragging rights on getting the most money,\" one NFC executive said.</p>\n<p>But Drew Rosenhaus, owner of Rosenhaus Sports Representation whose extensive client list boasts some of the NFL's top playmakers outside of the quarterback position, offered an alternative view.</p>\n<p>\"As an agent you try to balance it,\" Rosenhaus said. \"You want to get the best deal for your client, but you're also interested in going to the right circumstance.\"</p>\n<p>For the Mahomes deal, it was a giant puzzle that included not only putting a contract together but examining what each piece meant to the puzzle -- it was about being paid what he earned but also about setting the organization up for long-term success.</p>\n<p>\"For any quarterback at the end of the day, what your career is going to be measured by is 'Did you win? Did you win Super Bowls?' And if you can win multiple, you join a very, very exclusive club where obviously Tom Brady is at the top of the mountain\" Cabott said.</p>\n<p>Said Beane: \"You got to think about your legacy, your career and the more money you take ... the less I can do to put weapons around you.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>THE EAGLES SET</strong> the market with Hurts' deal. The Ravens followed, paying Jackson a little bit more. Now, the Chargers and Bengals are chasing an ever-increasing number.</p>\n<p>For Herbert and Burrow, it's possible one is waiting for the other, knowing he will get a little more.</p>\n<p>And many executives hope their quarterback is different.</p>\n<p>\"At least in our situation, I don't think I need to have that talk with our quarterback. I think he's fully aware, has really good self-awareness on how much money he is going to make, how it affects the team,\" Telesco said. \"But like most agents will tell you, like, it's my job to figure out how to make sure that the player gets the value that he deserves and we build a team around him.\"</p>\n<p>Herbert acknowledged seeing Hurts' and Jackson's new deals, but deferred to his representation when asked about the balance of getting paid and building a Super Bowl-caliber cast around him.</p>\n<photo3>\n<p>\"That's the great thing about the people that I hired to work on my behalf is, I kind of leave it up to them because they're the experts and I don't know nearly enough about those negotiations, about those extensions,\" Herbert said. \"... I have to be the best quarterback that I can be ... but obviously putting your input and making sure that everyone knows exactly what you would like from the situation.\"</p>\n<p>Even with a recent influx of massive salaries, which included signing cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121649/jc-jackson\">J.C.

It's just when you go through a grind of a week of training and you're trying to push it and go through the rehab process, but at the same time you want to make sure you're still building, you might be a little sore on the weekends. But I think we've done a great job of pushing it to the right limit to where now I'm throwing.</p>\n<p>\"There will still be a little bit of limitations going the next few weeks, but I'm going to be happy with where I'm at and we'll keep pushing it and getting me to the right spot before the beginning of the season.\"</p>\n<p>Mahomes was injured during the Chiefs' divisional round playoff win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> and played at something less than full strength during the rest of that game, the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl LVII. He still played well enough in the conference championship game and the Super Bowl win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> to throw for a combined 508 yards and five touchdowns.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Mahomes was limited in the offseason two years ago after having toe surgery for an injury that plagued him in the Chiefs' Super Bowl LV loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. The team started the next season in 2021 at 3-4, by far its worst beginning to a season since Mahomes became the starting quarterback. Mahomes said he felt limited physically to begin that season because of the surgery.</p>\n<p>No surgery was necessary for the high ankle sprain, and he said this injury wouldn't be a similar problem lingering into the season.</p>\n<p>\"The foot, with having the surgery and having that cast on it, it just really cut my mobility down a lot and so I had to really work through that even into the season that next year,\" Mahomes said.</p>\n<p>\"With the ankle, I've felt like we've improved, especially these last few weeks, a ton as far as the swelling. That went down finally. I don't have that soreness just as much as I was having it after a few days of work. With the improvements that we're making these last few weeks, I have a great feeling that by the time we get to training camp, it wouldn't even be any question at all. We'll continue to work through it. By OTAs [starting in May], I don't think there'll be any limitations on reps or anything like that, especially if I'm not running around a ton.

  "<p>PHOENIX -- While NFL owners opted not to vote on a rule that would allow games to be flexed into a Thursday night kickoff, they agreed Tuesday to modify the existing rule and allow teams to play a maximum of two short-week games.</p>\n<p>That means that while some teams could play two Thursday night games, others would not have any. Back-to-back Thursday night games, such as a Thanksgiving game followed by a Thursday night game the next week, would only count as one short-week game, so some teams could wind up playing three Thursday games.</p>\n<p>\"We're interested in making sure that we get exposure for all of our clubs,\" said Brian Rolapp, NFL executive vice president and chief media and business officer.</p>\n<p>\"We also believe that these national windows are for clubs that are playing well.

What are we thinking about?\"</p>\n<p>Mara also said he's frustrated that the idea was presented to the owners at the league meetings this week with no advance warning.</p>\n<p>\"This should have been vetted with the health and safety committee, it should have been vetted with the competition committee, and it was not,\" Mara said. \"They just tried to push it through.\"</p>\n<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell pushed back against Mara's assertion that the practice would be \"abusive\" to fans, saying the league is trying to balance the best interests of in-stadium fans with those watching on television from home.</p>\n<p>\"There isn't anybody in any of our organization that doesn't put our fans first,\" Goodell said. \"Providing the best matchups for our fans is what we do. That's part of what our schedule has always focused on. Flex has been part of that. We are very judicious with it and careful with it. We look at all the impacts of that before a decision is made.\"</p>\n<p>Players also appeared to be critical of the decision to increase the number of Thursday night games a team can play. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, the league's reigning MVP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes/status/1640852355955523585?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted the news with a facepalm emoji</a>.</p>\n<p>Asked about Mahomes' reaction, Goodell stressed that the league isn't prioritizing a broadcast partner over the health and safety of players.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think we are putting Amazon (which has Thursday night rights) over players' interest,\" Goodell said. \"We look at data with respect to injuries and impact on players. ... I think we have data that's very clear, it doesn't show higher injury rate.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hear from a lot of players directly. too. They have 10 days (off) afterwards. So there's some benefits on that side.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> president and CEO Art Rooney II said he was in favor of two Thursday night games, but he also opposed the Thursday flex.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't support the flex part,\" Rooney said. \"I think that if we are smart about how we schedule the teams ... if they're playing two Thursday nights, I mean, for instance, you can give them back-to-back Thursdays, things like that, and have a bye on one end or things like that. I think it can be done in a way that teams will be able to live with it. It provides more inventory to schedule on Thursday night, so it can be a good thing.</p>\n<p>\"The biggest problem I had with the flex was that the proposal was that you only had 15 days' notice. That's just too short of a turnaround time for a flex from a Sunday to Thursday, as far as I'm concerned.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

One notable exception has been Ekeler, who has vastly outplayed the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28851620/source-chargers-rb-austin-ekeler-reach-4-year-245m-deal\">four-year, $24 million deal</a> he inked with the Chargers in 2020. Since moving into the lead role in 2021, he ranks third among backs in yards from scrimmage and has 38 touchdowns, 12 more than any other player.</p>\n<p>Advanced metrics are also fond of Ekeler's work. For a back who was once considered too small to play near the goal line, he has scored 12 touchdowns on 17 carries inside the 3-yard line, generating three conversions more than an average back would have in the same spots, per NFL Next Gen Stats. He has averaged 1.75 yards per route run over that stretch, in line with No. 1 wideouts such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans\">Mike Evans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3932905/diontae-johnson\">Diontae Johnson</a>.</p>\n<p>At 27, Ekeler is still young enough to be a valuable part of a great offense over the next several seasons. That offense might not be in Los Angeles, as the Chargers reportedly weren't willing to give him what he wanted and have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35851157/chargers-austin-ekeler-eyes-trade-extension-talks-stall\">allowed his representation to look for a trade</a>. Everyone would agree he deserves a raise, but the Chargers are heavily invested at wide receiver with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15818/keenan-allen\">Keenan Allen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045138/mike-williams\">Mike Williams</a>, handed out significant money to center <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16864/corey-linsley\">Corey Linsley</a> and are about to give <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3068267/austin-ekeler\">Justin Herbert</a> a massive raise.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p>It's unclear what Ekeler is looking for on a new deal, but it would hardly be unreasonable to ask for double the $6.25 million he's owed in 2023. In a different era (and adjusting for the changes in the salary cap), he would have no shortage of suitors at that price. This year, with teams loath to spend money on veteran running backs, the Chargers are likely letting him explore trade options because they don't think he'll find a fit.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>Run through the league. How many teams are in position and inclined to pay a running back, even one as talented as Ekeler, north of $12 million per season? Not many. The Bills repeatedly have looked to add a receiving back in recent years, but they don't have the cap space. Neither do the Chiefs, Buccaneers or Rams. The Eagles just signed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139925/rashaad-penny\">Rashaad Penny</a> and don't spend significant money on backs.</p>\n<p><a name=\"mahomes\"></a></p>\n<p>The most obvious landing spot might be in Carolina. The Panthers desperately need help at receiver after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35830753/bears-trading-no-1-overall-pick-panthers-wr-dj-moore-multiple-picks\">trading away DJ Moore in the deal</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/35830878/panthers-bears-trade-top-pick-2023-nfl-draft-winners-losers-questions-league-impact-picks\">No. 1 overall pick</a>, and Ekeler would be both a creative solution to their problem and a safety valve for a rookie passer. I'm not sure they would be desperate to pay a running back after going through a frustrating time with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a> contract, but this might be a better use of their money than paying for someone such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> in free agency. They are also low on draft capital after the move up No. 1, making a trade difficult. My guess is that Ekeler returns to L.A. in 2023.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>Are the Chiefs putting <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> at risk?</h2>\n<p>Speaking of Smith-Schuster, let's get to the defending champs. One year after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33578655/tyreek-hill-trade-kansas-city-chiefs-miami-dolphins-sends-shock-waves-social-media\">trading Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35649198/how-patrick-mahomes-chiefs-played-perfect-second-half-super-bowl-2023-nfl-win-jalen-hurts-eagles\">winning a Super Bowl</a> anyway, coach Andy Reid & Co. were comfortable walking away from another key offensive player this offseason. The organization once sent a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31317874/kansas-city-chiefs-sending-3-picks-baltimore-ravens-part-orlando-brown-package\">first-round pick to the Ravens</a> as part of the package to acquire tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116370/orlando-brown-jr\">Orlando Brown Jr.</a>, but after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34248614/source-kansas-city-chiefs-lt-orlando-brown-jr-play-franchise-tag-sides-fail-reach-deal\">franchising</a> him a year ago, it decided to let him leave in free agency this offseason. Brown was much closer to good than great during his time in Kansas City, but moving on for nothing was a curious move for a team that didn't have a clear replacement on the roster.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs' plan for replacing Brown became clear Monday. They signed former Jaguars right tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034961/jawaan-taylor\">Jawaan Taylor</a> to a deal that will pay him <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35851858/sources-jaguars-ot-jawaan-taylor-chiefs-80m-deal\">$60 million over the next three years</a>. Subsequent reports and the price of Taylor's deal imply they plan to move Taylor, 25, to the left side of the line to protect Mahomes' blind side.</p>\n<p>Now, when the Chiefs acquired Brown, they traded for a player who had spent the vast majority of his pro career on the right side. Brown had started nine games at left tackle for Baltimore, filling in for the injured <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980153/ronnie-stanley\">Ronnie Stanley</a>, and requested a trade because he wanted to play the position full time. Left tackles get paid a premium; the top 10 in the league heading into this season averaged about $18.5 million per season on their deals, while the top 10 right tackles came in around $14.3 million.</p>\n<p>Taylor, on the other hand, has never started an NFL game at left tackle. When the Jaguars lost left tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115313/cam-robinson\">Cam Robinson</a> to an injury last December, they installed swing tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242554/walker-little\">Walker Little</a> on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>'s blind side and kept Taylor on the right side. Taylor took only a handful of snaps at left tackle during his time in college. The Chiefs are about to protect the most valuable blind side in football with a guy who has not played left tackle regularly <i>since high school</i>. This seems aggressive!</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Switching from one side to the other isn't impossible by any means, but it's harder than you might think. Footwork changes. The angles and timing as a blocker are unfamiliar. Right tackles typically get help more often from tight ends than left tackles -- they're out on an island more often.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs will have a new right tackle after losing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042702/andrew-wylie\">Andrew Wylie</a> in free agency <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35852598/sources-commanders-agree-3-year-24m-deal-andrew-wylie\">to the Commanders</a>, so Taylor is going to be the tackle they lean on in 2023. He's also moving from a quarterback who threw the ball at the league's third-fastest rate in 2022 to Mahomes, who got rid of the ball at the 24th-fastest rate. The Chiefs are making a very big bet with this move.</p>\n<p><a name=\"eagles\"></a></p>\n<p>If this were most other teams, I would be terrified. Given that it's Reid, though, I'm willing to give him some benefit of the doubt. Reid generally has had impeccable taste in left tackles: He helped mold <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5081777/tra-thomas\">Tra Thomas</a> into a Pro Bowler in Philadelphia before trading for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6012/jason-peters\">Jason Peters</a>, who will join Reid in the Hall of Fame one day. Reid used his first pick with the Chiefs on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15790/eric-fisher\">Eric Fisher</a>, then transitioned to Brown. If he thinks Taylor can play left tackle, I'm willing to take the plunge. There just might be a scary moment or two along the way.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>Should the Eagles have been more aggressive about trying to keep their roster together?</h2>\n<p>The Eagles were the NFL's most complete team in 2022, but it'll be tough for them to claim that same spot in 2023. After losing both coordinators to head-coaching jobs, they already have had several key defensive contributors walk out the door in free agency. Star defensive tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2983055/javon-hargrave\">Javon Hargrave</a> signed with the 49ers, while starting linebackers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4039254/kyzir-white\">Kyzir White</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121544/tj-edwards\">T.J.

Safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139368/marcus-epps\">Marcus Epps</a>, who missed just 10 defensive snaps during the regular season, left for the Raiders. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15863/darius-slay\">Darius Slay</a>, the team's top cornerback, was on the chopping block Wednesday but now is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35868793/pro-bowl-cb-darius-slay-expected-stay-eagles-source-says\">expected to return to the team</a>.</p>\n<p>It's not all doom and gloom.

General manager Howie Roseman will do what he can to finesse their cap situation, but they were in a mess during <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz\">Carson Wentz</a>'s last season with the team in 2020. They haven't had years to roll over gobs of money.</p>\n<p>This team already has made significant commitments in terms of average annual salary to three offensive linemen, a tight end, a wide receiver, two edge rushers and (for now) two cornerbacks. Hurts' deal has to come from somewhere. The Eagles value depth along the line of scrimmage more than any other team, so they're going to cut back on linebackers and safeties and try to draft and develop players there. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426340/nakobe-dean\">Nakobe Dean</a> will step in for Edwards. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361178/cam-jurgens\">Cam Jurgens</a> likely will replace Seumalo.

This is a player the Rams <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27854825/jaguars-send-jalen-ramsey-rams-pair-1st-rounders\">traded two first-round picks to acquire</a> in 2019 before Ramsey was a first-team All-Pro in 2020 and 2021. If you told a Rams fan this time last year they would deal a healthy Ramsey for a third-round pick and a guy who played 93 snaps on offense last season, they would have laughed at you. A year later, here we are.</p>\n<p>Money plays a big role here. The Rams are trying to free up some as they retool after a chastening 5-12 season. They've cut linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14979/bobby-wagner\">Bobby Wagner</a> and edge rusher <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043136/leonard-floyd\">Leonard Floyd</a> and offered to eat money to accommodate a trade for disappointing wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16799/allen-robinson-ii\">Allen Robinson</a>. Their roster looks unrecognizable from the one that landed a Super Bowl at home last February:</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Ramsey had three years and $55 million left on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29844575/rams-cb-jalen-ramsey-agree-five-year-105m-contract-agent-says\">his extension</a>, none of which was guaranteed. He reportedly wanted the Rams to guarantee his 2023 and 2024 base salaries, which were worth a combined $31.5 million. A new deal was likely to follow, probably as early as next offseason. The last time he wanted a new contract, he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27248889/jags-ramsey-arrives-camp-armored-truck\">showed up in a literal armored truck</a> at training camp with a hype man. The man is not subtle.</p>\n<p>The Rams weren't willing to do it. Given the fact that no team was willing to top a third-round pick for a 28-year-old future Hall of Famer, it doesn't appear many other teams found the idea particularly appealing, either. Ramsey took a step backward in 2022, with his passer rating in coverage <a href=\" https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RamsJa00.htm\" target=\"_new\">jumping from 71.1 to 84.5</a>, but he's a smart, versatile player. The money he wanted guaranteed isn't much more than what the Bengals gave <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576283/trae-waynes\">Trae Waynes</a> in free agency three years ago on a smaller cap. It's a bit of a surprise that L.A. was willing to move on from a franchise cornerstone for a midround selection and cap space.</p>\n<p>The Gilmore move seems more in line with the past, but it still tells us what little appetite there is for corners exiting their prime. At 32, Gilmore has toiled anonymously for a pair of bad teams over the past couple of seasons in the Panthers and Colts. He was good in his season with the Colts, <a href=\" https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GilmSt00.htm\" target=\"_new\">allowing a 74.0 passer rating while playing 99% of the defensive snaps</a>, but a rebuilding Indianapolis team didn't have much use for a mid-30s corner.</p>\n<p><a name=\"patriots\"></a></p>\n<p>The Cowboys do, and they'll pay Gilmore just under $10 million in 2023 to play across from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040966/trevon-diggs\">Trevon Diggs</a>. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>What are the Patriots thinking at receiver?</h2>\n<p>In a league where most teams are desperate to get their quarterback as many playmakers as possible, Bill Belichick & Co. appear to be going in the other direction. The Pats <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35850582/source-falcons-acquire-te-jonnu-smith-patriots-pick\">traded</a> disappointing tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054212/jonnu-smith\">Jonnu Smith</a> to the Falcons just before the legal tampering period and already have lost <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916433/jakobi-meyers\">Jakobi Meyers</a>, their top wideout over the past two seasons, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35857215/sources-raiders-add-wr-jakobi-meyers-3-year-deal\">to the Raiders</a> in free agency. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971618/nelson-agholor\">Nelson Agholor</a>, another underwhelming member of the free agent class of 2021, is back on the market.</p>\n<p>New England's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/depth/_/name/ne\">depth chart</a> isn't pretty. It has <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046439/hunter-henry\">Hunter Henry</a> at tight end and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576623/devante-parker\">Devante Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045523/kendrick-bourne\">Kendrick Bourne</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362921/tyquan-thornton\">Tyquan Thornton</a> at wide receiver. Parker now has one season with more than 800 receiving yards in seven tries, as his 2019 campaign looks like a flash in the pan. Bourne fell out of favor with the coaching staff and barely played for long stretches last season. Thornton was exciting as a rookie, but he's not close to being a complete player. In a make-or-break season for quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241464/mac-jones\">Mac Jones</a>, that's not just good enough of a receiving corps.</p>\n<p>The Pats could consider a wide receiver with the No. 14 overall pick, but it's more likely they use that selection on a left tackle. The top wideout on the trade market is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins\">DeAndre Hopkins</a>; Belichick <a href=\"https://twitter.com/minakimes/status/1635770345285353472\" target=\"_new\">regards Hopkins as a superstar</a>, but his new offensive coordinator is Bill O'Brien, whose <a href=\" https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/bill-obrien-deandre-hopkins-relationship-timeline-patriots-trade\" target=\"_new\">tumultuous relationship with Hopkins in Houston</a> culminated in a disastrous trade. Bygones can always be bygones, but it's difficult to imagine Hopkins being thrilled about reuniting with his former coach.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>My instinct is that the Patriots have learned from their mistakes in 2021. Then, without much on the receiving depth chart and with a rookie quarterback, they went all-in on the first two days of free agency to sign Agholor, Bourne, Henry and Smith. Many of those deals didn't look good a few days later, when arguably better players signed smaller deals to go elsewhere. Agholor and Smith are gone without much of an impact, and Bourne might join them on the market before the end of the offseason.</p>\n<p><a name=\"broncos\"></a></p>\n<p>If Belichick is willing to be patient, he might land more reasonable deals. This isn't a great market for wide receivers, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115394/dj-chark\">DJ Chark</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916945/darius-slayton\">Darius Slayton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123075/braxton-berrios\">Braxton Berrios</a> are available. Adding a couple of those players won't land the Pats a No. 1 target, but they could try to build a deeper depth chart without any stars. <em>(Update: The Pats on Wednesday afternoon <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35866021/sources-juju-smith-schuster-patriots-3-year-33m-deal\">signed Smith-Schuster</a> to a three-year deal.)</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/den.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>What do Denver's moves tell us about how Sean Payton's going to try to fix <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>?</h2>\n<p>Bigger is better. In Payton's first free agent window with his new organization, the Broncos emulated some of the tactics we saw from his tenure in New Orleans. At the tail end of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees\">Drew Brees</a>' career, the Saints prioritized building a deep, dominant offensive line to protect their quarterback. The team imported veteran standouts such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12624/max-unger\">Max Unger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15870/larry-warford\">Larry Warford</a> before using three first-round picks and a second-rounder across five drafts on linemen.</p>\n<p>The Broncos don't have that draft capital after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33454258/sources-seattle-seahawks-trade-qb-russell-wilson-denver-broncos\">trading it for Wilson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35564875/sources-broncos-finalizing-deal-saints-sean-payton\">Payton</a>, so off they went into free agency. On the first day of the legal tampering period, they handed a massive deal to former 49ers right tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052885/mike-mcglinchey\">Mike McGlinchey</a>. The ninth pick in the 2018 draft never seemed to emerge as an upper-echelon tackle in San Francisco, but Denver gave him <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35851129/source-ravens-guard-ben-powers-sign-broncos\">$52.5 million over the first three years</a> of a five-year pact, the second-largest mark for any right tackle in football. It followed up with a four-year, $51.5 million deal for former Ravens guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4037650/ben-powers\">Ben Powers</a>, who completed his first full season as a starter in 2022.</p>\n<p>The Broncos' third move wasn't as significant, but it might be more telling, as they <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/denver-broncos/post/_/id/41637/denver-broncos-2023-free-agent-signings\">inked</a> former Jaguars tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2531358/chris-manhertz\">Chris Manhertz</a> to a two-year, $6 million pact. Manhertz will come in to play the same role <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13387/michael-hoomanawanui\">Michael Hoomanawanui</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16143/josh-hill\">Josh Hill</a> played at different times for Payton in New Orleans, the run-blocking tight end who occasionally slips out off play-action to hit a big play or two. With 2022 second-rounder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4367209/greg-dulcich\">Greg Dulcich</a> on the roster, Denver might play more 12 personnel.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>All these moves suggest Payton is going to place a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35719824/can-sean-payton-guide-russell-wilson-back-dominance-denver-broncos\">heavier focus on running the football</a> to take some of the pressure off Wilson. If the Broncos are going to operate out of 12 personnel and throw the ball less often, a team that has spent heavily might be operating from a surplus of wide receivers. It's no surprise that ESPN's Dan Graziano has reported <a href=\" https://twitter.com/DanGrazianoESPN/status/1635321794742632448\" target=\"_new\">the Broncos are talking with teams about trading away one of their wide receivers</a> between <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128429/courtland-sutton\">Courtland Sutton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241463/jerry-jeudy\">Jerry Jeudy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240380/kj-hamler\">KJ Hamler</a>.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the price they would get in return depends on which receiver they choose to deal away. Jeudy hasn't had that breakout season everyone's waiting to see, but he did average an impressive 2.27 yards per route run in a broken offense last season, which was in line with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976499/amari-cooper\">Amari Cooper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121422/terry-mclaurin\">Terry McLaurin</a>. Hamler has been limited to 312 snaps over the past two seasons with injuries, but he has shown field-stretching speed at times. Sutton has the only 1,000-yard season of the group, but he's three years removed from that campaign and is owed $14.5 million in 2023.</p>\n<p><a name=\"saints\"></a></p>\n<p>Subtracting a wide receiver doesn't sound like it'll help Wilson, but the Broncos are retooling without many draft picks. Moving toward a more balanced offense sounds more like the attack Wilson wanted to escape for years in Seattle, but after the disaster that was 2022, something more familiar might be the first step in getting the embattled signal-caller back on track.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/no.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>Can the Saints rebuild an entire position on the fly?</h2>\n<p>If you're a Saints fan, you're rightfully excited about what they've been able to do with limited cap space in retooling on offense. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a> joined from the Raiders. Quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston\">Jameis Winston</a> and wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas\">Michael Thomas</a> both were expected to be cut, but New Orleans was able to convince both players to come back on reduced deals. Thomas is now three full seasons removed from his last dominant campaign in 2019, but if he somehow returns to that form with Carr, he would be a bargain.</p>\n<p>The defense is another story altogether. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13971/cameron-jordan\">Cameron Jordan</a> took the latest in a series of restructures to create cap space, <a href=\" https://twitter.com/camjordan94/status/1635316153978597376\" target=\"_new\">then suggested (or hoped) on Twitter </a>that the Saints would use the room to sign a prolific defensive tackle. I'm not sure they had the sort of space Jordan was hoping for in sending off that tweet, but what happened next wasn't exactly exciting, either.</p>\n<p>Just about every other significant defensive lineman the Saints have went out the door. Even worse, several joined division rivals. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4002046/david-onyemata\">David Onyemata</a>, the team's best, left for the Falcons. (He was followed by linebacker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124890/kaden-elliss\">Kaden Elliss</a>.) <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886601/shy-tuttle\">Shy Tuttle</a> also stayed in the South and went to the Panthers. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124058/marcus-davenport\">Marcus Davenport</a>, the defensive end the team once <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2018/story/_/id/23329753/new-orleans-saints-move-13-spots-draft-de-marcus-davenport-trade-2019-first-round-pick-green-bay-packers\">used two first-round picks to acquire</a>, inked a one-year deal with the Vikings. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116726/kentavius-street\">Kentavius Street</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4039064/malcolm-roach\">Malcolm Roach</a>, the other members of the defensive tackle rotation, are both free agents. That's a combined 2,562 defensive snaps out the door, including virtually every snap at tackle.</p>\n<p>The Saints can stay put with what they have on the edge. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240269/payton-turner\">Payton Turner</a> has been limited by injuries to just 314 snaps over his first two seasons, but the former first-round pick will need to move into a bigger role. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918310/carl-granderson\">Carl Granderson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2982313/tanoh-kpassagnon\">Tanoh Kpassagnon</a> will be in the mix on the outside. They never replaced <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson\">Trey Hendrickson</a> -- and Jordan turns 34 in July -- but edge isn't the problem here.</p>\n<p><video2></video2></p>\n<p>At defensive tackle? The Saints are starting over from scratch. They'll have to do that with limited cap space, which means they'll be shopping on the cheap. Onyemata and Davenport, who are playing for other teams this season, are responsible for a combined $17.8 million on the Saints cap in 2023 despite leaving the organization. General manager Mickey Loomis will use voidable years and future restructures to create space, but the team isn't likely to go out and land a superstar tackle up front.</p>\n<p>The Saints started Wednesday morning with no tackles, but they added two by lunch. Dennis Allen's defense imported a pair of backup tackles from other teams in 29-year-old <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4076951/nathan-shepherd\">Nathan Shepherd</a> (Jets) and 26-year-old Super Bowl winner <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121634/khalen-saunders\">Khalen Saunders</a> (Chiefs), who posted a career-high 3.5 sacks last season. Those players took about 40% of the snaps for their former teams in 2022; they'll likely expand into larger roles in 2023, if only because there's going to be plenty of opportunities to go around.</p>\n<p>The Saints were the <a href=\" https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/1616140473797644290\" target=\"_New\">league's oldest team in 2023</a>, so they don't really have much choice beyond getting younger up front. Landing the No. 29 overall pick for Payton gave them a much-needed draft pick to use on a starting tackle. I would expect them to also add another veteran to the mix, but like their additions of wideout <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16790/jarvis-landry\">Jarvis Landry</a> and safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15851/tyrann-mathieu\">Tyrann Mathieu</a> a year ago, they might wait to see whose market doesn't develop before pouncing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"31\"></p>\n<h2>What is the Jets' backup plan if <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> doesn't join them?</h2>\n<p>Let me start with this: I still think Rodgers ends up on the Jets. (<em>Update: Rodgers said Wednesday on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that he i<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35865345/aaron-rodgers-says-wants-play-jets-2023\">ntends to play for the Jets</a> this season.</em>) Everyone involved should be motivated to make a move happen. The chatter around the deal has been incessant for <em>weeks</em>. There's no other obvious landing spot for the future Hall of Famer, especially if the Packers want to keep him out of the NFC. It's clear Green Bay wants to move forward with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036378/jordan-love\">Jordan Love</a> as its starter, which would mean <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/green-bay-packers/post/_/id/52990/why-the-transition-to-jordan-love-whenever-it-happens-will-require-patience-for-packers\">picking up his fifth-year option for 2024</a> by May.</p>\n<p>As someone who once wrote an entire column about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13934/antonio-brown\">Antonio Brown</a> being traded to the Bills, though, I know things can change. Smoke doesn't always equal fire. The majority of people I've spoken to around the league expected this deal to be done, at least in name, before the legal tampering period began Monday. Instead, it's unclear whether Rodgers has even confirmed he'll play anywhere in 2023, let alone for the Jets.</p>\n<p>While it has been waiting, many of New York's other options have gone in other directions. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>, who the organization reportedly said could become \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/1628163450890338306\">a first-ballot Hall of Famer</a>\" if he signed there, went to New Orleans. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo\">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> signed with the Raiders. Even secondary options such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2565969/taylor-heinicke\">Taylor Heinicke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14012/andy-dalton\">Andy Dalton</a> and Jets cult hero <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051381/mike-white\">Mike White</a> found deals elsewhere.</p>\n<p>So, let's say Rodgers decides to retire. What could the Jets do next?</p>\n<p><b>Sign <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett\">Jacoby Brissett</a>.</b> Brissett had the best 2022 season of the remaining free agent quarterbacks. He finished with a 60.0 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr\">Total QBR</a>, the eighth-best mark in football, placing him just in front of  <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson,</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> and well ahead of Rodgers, who came in at 26th. Brissett, 30, averaged more yards per attempt and was more effective as a runner. Oh, he's also nine years younger than his counterpart and he'll come at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>I was talking myself into Brissett over Rodgers there! I don't think Brissett was really the league's eighth-best quarterback last season, but I do think he's underrated and someone who could be a much cheaper replacement. Brissett doesn't have Rodgers' improvisational skills, but he comes close to matching Rodgers' historically impressive ability to protect the football. Brissett has thrown interceptions on just 1.5% of his passes since entering the league in 2016. Rodgers is at 1.1% over that same time frame. If the Jets' game plan is going to be to win with defense and protect the football, Brissett should fit.</p>\n<p><b>Sign another free agent.</b> The other options available aren't exactly inspiring. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota\">Marcus Mariota</a> ran the LaFleur offense in Tennessee, so if Jets coordinator Nathaniel Hackett plans to install a version of that attack, Mariota has some experience. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16728/teddy-bridgewater\">Teddy Bridgewater</a>, who spent a preseason with the Jets in 2018, has been an entirely competent starter when given the opportunity and won plenty of games on teams with good defenses. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz\">Carson Wentz</a> is around if the Jets want to redirect some of the fan base's vitriol against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361259/zach-wilson\">Zach Wilson</a> toward another player.</p>\n<p><b>Consider trading for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill\">Ryan Tannehill</a>.</b> It isn't as if there are many teams that have a quarterback they're desperate to unload, so the Jets would need to pay a premium. The two most notable choices are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a> and Tannehill. Stafford started last season dealing with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34547927/los-angeles-rams-qb-matthew-stafford-underwent-offseason-elbow-procedure-sources-say\">an elbow issue</a>, finished with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35294794/rams-matthew-stafford-says-spinal-contusion-force-retire\">spinal cord contusion</a> and has thrown 19 interceptions across his past 17 regular-season games. He has a $26 million option bonus that needs to be exercised by Friday, so if the Rams were willing to do this deal, the Jets don't have much time to get it done.</p>\n<p>Tannehill, 34, has $27 million due in the final year of his deal for a Titans team that appears to be blowing things up and rebuilding. He generally posts excellent efficiency numbers, but the Titans only call on him to throw the ball about 28 times per game. If Hackett installs something like the offense we saw in Green Bay, Tannehill should be comfortable. He's a realistic option.</p>\n<p><b>Sign <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> to an offer sheet.</b> Jackson is the most notable name behind Rodgers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/35803270/lamar-jackson-trade-fits-ranking-nfl-teams-ravens-quarterback-franchise-tag\">on the market</a>, but I don't think it's a great fit. The Jets have only $16 million in cap space, so they would need to give him a deal without a huge first-year number to get the contract he reportedly wants on the books. Formulating that sort of deal isn't a problem, but it also makes that contract easier for the Ravens to match.</p>\n<p>With the No. 13 overall pick in April's draft and a 2024 first-rounder going to the Ravens, I'm not sure Baltimore would be blown away with the compensation and prefer to keep the picks. Jackson is the best player the Jets can acquire if Rodgers is off the table, but I don't think it's likely to be the backup plan.</p>\n<p><video1></video1></p>\n<p><b>Move forward with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361259/zach-wilson\">Zach Wilson</a>.</b> I'm not saying it's a good idea, but coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas both have suggested Wilson is going to be <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/new-york-jets/post/_/id/91401/jets-plan-for-zach-wilson-is-highly-unusual-could-lead-to-future-trade\">part of this franchise in the future</a>.

I'd prefer Brissett or Tannehill, but these are the same people who believed Wilson was a franchise quarterback in the making as recently as last September.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video1> </video1></p>\n<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> went back to the future with their <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35728078/matt-nagy-gets-second-stint-chiefs-offensive-coordinator\" target=\"_blank\">promotion of Matt Nagy as offensive coordinator</a>. The team announced the move on Friday, one week after former offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy's departure. Bieniemy was the offensive coordinator for the past five seasons before taking a similar position with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-commanders\">Washington Commanders</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nagy, 44, was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator for head coach Andy Reid in 2016 and 2017, their last two seasons with Alex Smith as their starting quarterback. The Chiefs were 20th in the league in yards and 13th in scoring in 2016 but made a jump the next season to fifth in yards and sixth in scoring.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nagy then left for four seasons to be the head coach for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a> from 2018 to 2021. He returned to the Chiefs last year as quarterbacks coach and senior offensive assistant.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>What does this mean for quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> and the Chiefs?</h2>\n\n\n<p>In a word: stability. Nagy coached under Reid for three seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> and then came to the Chiefs as quarterbacks coach when Reid arrived in 2013.</p>\n\n\n<p>That continuity is important for Mahomes, who in the past year has seen the departure of Bieniemy, former Chiefs quarterbacks coach Mike Kafka and long-time backup quarterback Chad Henne, who retired after Super Bowl LVII. Henne was a major influence for Mahomes, particularly early in his career. The Chiefs at the time wanted a veteran quarterback to help serve as a mentor for Mahomes.</p>\n\n\n<p>Reid said last year that continuity was one of the reasons he was eager to get Nagy back on the Chiefs' staff and working with Mahomes. Mahomes was a rookie backup in 2017 when Nagy was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo1></p>\n<h2>Why did the Chiefs choose Nagy?</h2>\n\n\n<p>In addition to staff stability, Reid has long thought highly of Nagy. While Nagy was coaching in high school in Pennsylvania, he was a training camp intern for the Eagles for two years before Reid brought him onto his staff full time.</p>\n\n\n<p>Reid many years ago thought of Nagy as a potential head coach. When Nagy was promoted to Chiefs offensive coordinator, Reid was so sure Nagy would become a head coach in little time that he immediately started grooming Bieniemy, then the running backs coach, to be his eventual replacement.</p>\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, the Chiefs were successful with Nagy as an assistant coach. They made the playoffs in four of Nagy's five seasons in Kansas City during his first go-round and then last year won Super Bowl LVII in his first season back.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>How will Nagy's offense be different than Bieniemy's?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Expect any change to be subtle. As long as Reid remains head coach, he will have considerable influence over the offense and the direction it heads.<alsosee></p>\n\n\n<p>The Chiefs were ninth in the NFL in rushing in 2017, Nagy's last season as offensive coordinator before leaving for the Bears. They haven't been above 16th since, but that has less to do with Nagy's departure and more to do with the fact they installed Mahomes as their quarterback just as Nagy was leaving. They won't turn into a predominantly rushing team as long as Mahomes is their quarterback.</p>\n\n\n<p>Bieniemy had his own way of doing things, including an in-your-face style and an attention to detail that wore on some players. But they almost always responded.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nagy has a more restrained manner. It remains to be seen how the Chiefs will respond.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

From Raphael to Rubens, here's the story of the postseason through paintings.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The divine <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>Mahomes suffered a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24655304/patrick-mahomes-michael-jordan-performances-injury-illness\">high ankle injury</a> in the AFC divisional round against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. The injury usually requires a recovery time of 4-6 weeks. Mahomes missed a single series. Often hobbling, he threw for 508 yards and five scores in the two games following the injury while winning Super Bowl MVP honors. Some might call that miraculous.</p>\n<p>\"Whoever is capturing the image in sports does similar things to what a titan does, where you want to elicit a reaction,\" Rader said. \"You want to show the beauty and movement of an athlete the same way you might want to show the beauty and movement of a religious scene.\"</p>\n<p>Rader chose three different paintings featuring Jesus Christ for his posts about Mahomes.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n<h2>Hang these plays in the Louvre</h2>\n\n\n<p>Art But Make It Sports began in 2015. Its database of world class paintings is often the extent of the pictures on Rader's phone. He has pictures of around 7,500 paintings from museums he has visited around the world. Rader said he has tried to memorize what's in his photo archive so that he is ready when a play or moment in a game happens.</p>\n<p>\"There's a sports image that happens in a game and I either know exactly, off the top of my head, the [artwork] is something I've taken a photo of or seen,\" Rader said. \"I can tell what it might look like, what art history motif it might be ...or start to think about what artist's style that might be.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>High Renaissance and Baroque were his themes for the NFL playoffs. Britannica describes Baroque as \"stylistically complex, even contradictory. In general, however, the desire to evoke emotional states by appealing to the senses, often in dramatic ways, underlies its manifestations.\"</p>\n<p>Battling styles? Emotions and drama? Surely a Baroque artist would love postseason sports. However, while Raphael's work is known for its grandeur and what Britannica calls a classical spirit that is \"harmonious, beautiful and serene,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, featured next to the painter's \"Fire In The Borgo,\" might not agree.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>French Neoclassical painter Jacques Louis-David's work was used for two other plays from the AFC playoffs. Some memes don't always tell the whole story. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> QB Tyler Huntley's leaping attempt ended in a fumble which the Bengals returned 98 yards for a score. Napoleon was eventually exiled.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n\n\n<h2>Modern interpretations</h2>\n\n\n<p>While his memes often use medieval and Renaissance-era European paintings, Rader's personal favorites are more modern and include Alice Neel, Georgia O'Keeffe and Bill Traylor. Modern art, however, can be trickier to use because of interpretations of the human body.</p>\n<p>\"Modern artists represent people in more diverse and complex forms and styles than previous art movements, because they are on the other side of history with hundreds of years in between,\" Casas said.</p>\n<p>Impressionism, realism and contemporary styles were used to capture some of the scenes of the postseason.</p>\n<p><inline5></p>\n<p>\"I like old masters' work a lot, probably because they're good for meme fodder, but some of the more contemporary work I have a hard time getting behind,\" said Rader, of his favorite artists to use for the feed. \"The more abstract work can definitely play, if done correctly.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Sign me up.</p>\n<p><a name=\"mvp \"></a></p>\n<p><b>Field Yates, NFL analyst:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a> over <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">49ers</a>. I'll simplify this: The Chiefs have the best QB in the league, and the 49ers have the best roster when examining the non-QB players in place.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Who's your pick to be next season's MVP?</h2>\n<p><b>Bell: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a>. After a rough opening week (and let's remember he was coming off a preseason <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34413347/cincinnati-bengals-qb-joe-burrow-says-appendix-ruptured-prompting-surgery\">ruptured appendix</a>), Burrow returned to his calm and cool playmaking style, ultimately leading his team to eight straight wins in the back half of the regular season. If he starts next season fully healthy -- which would be the first time in three years -- he could put together a record year.</p>\n<p><b>Bowen: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a>. Herbert finished with 4,739 passing yards in 2022, the second most in the NFL behind Mahomes. With a new offensive system in '23 under <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35558060/sources-chargers-hiring-kellen-moore-new-oc\">coordinator Kellen Moore</a>, Herbert should have a stronger play-action/boot presence in the offense and see more vertical concepts, putting his physical tools to use.</p>\n<p><b>Clay: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a>. If the Eagles make another Super Bowl run, Hurts will undoubtedly be in the MVP race. He was a contender this past season and is set up for yet another huge year thanks, in part, to an elite offensive line and group of targets led by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047646/aj-brown\">A.J. Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241478/devonta-smith\">DeVonta Smith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\">Dallas Goedert</a>. Hurts' dual-threat role has allowed 38 passing and 23 rushing TDs over the past two seasons, and it's possible we've yet to see the 24-year-old's best work.</p>\n<p><b>Cockcroft: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a>. He has been outstanding in all three NFL seasons, has among the best groups of receivers in the league and has beaten defending MVP/Super Bowl champ (Mahomes) in high-leverage situations multiple times. Need I go on? As with my Super Bowl pick, I think it's his time to shine. For the second straight year, the league's MVP will also win the Super Bowl after such a long time without it happening.</p>\n<p><b>Miller: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, QB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a>. It's rare for a player to repeat as MVP, so I'm going away from the obvious choice of Mahomes and looking at the second-best quarterback in the NFL. Burrow has the targets around him that Allen, Herbert and even Hurts might not have in 2023. With receivers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362628/ja'marr-chase\">Ja'Marr Chase</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239993/tee-higgins\">Tee Higgins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045144/tyler-boyd\">Tyler Boyd</a> all on board for another run, Burrow is a lock to be on the shortlist for MVP.</p>\n<p><b>Moody: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Eagles</a>. Hurts' 2022 season was pivotal as it determined he was capable of being a franchise quarterback. During the regular season, he surpassed expectations. In the Super Bowl, he had 304 passing yards and 70 rushing yards against the Chiefs, and he should be even more calibrated with his supporting cast in 2023. A unique talent, Hurts also benefits from the Eagles' creative yet aggressive offense.</p>\n<p><video2></video2></p>\n<p><b>Reid: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs</a>. One of only 10 players to win at least two AP MVP awards, Mahomes was a big-play artist when he won his first in 2018 and a methodical tactician in earning his second this past season. There's a wide gap between Mahomes and the rest of the pack.</p>\n<p><b>Tannenbaum:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Chargers</a>. Getting back left tackle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242283/rashawn-slater\">Rashawn Slater</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35420832/chargers-rashawn-slater-return-practice-play-vs-jaguars\">played in just three games</a> in 2022, will allow Herbert to take the next step in his career. I'm predicting the Chargers to win the AFC West, too.</p>\n<p><b>Walder: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs.</a> I thought about Herbert, but Mahomes has to be the most likely. Sure, tight end <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> is getting older, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116370/orlando-brown-jr\">Orlando Brown Jr.</a> is a free agent. But you have to think the Chiefs find a way to add a receiver this offseason. And besides, Mahomes already won an MVP <em>without </em>a great wide receiver room.</p>\n<p><a name=\"interesting\"></a></p>\n<p><b>Yates:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Bengals</a>. There are a handful of players who all inspire great confidence here. However, I'll go with Burrow, given the way he finished this regular season and the likelihood that the top-tier receiving talent in Cincinnati is back and improved next year. Imagine Chase with another offseason under his belt?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Who is the most interesting team of the offseason?</h2>\n<p><b>Bell:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Raiders</a>. It's simple. Who's going to take over at the helm with the departure of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\">Derek Carr</a>? All-pro receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a> and running back <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047365/josh-jacobs\">Josh Jacobs</a> (assuming he returns) are already waiting in the wings. Besides, wouldn't the Raiders love to make a run at the Super Bowl being hosted in their own stadium next year?</p>\n<p><b>Bowen: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">Jets</a>. It's the quarterback. Potentially adding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> or Carr could change the dynamic of a Jets team featuring young, impact talent at several premium positions.</p>\n<p><b>Clay: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a>. I fully expect Detroit to be the most popular sleeper team this offseason. Coach Dan Campbell has the franchise headed in the right direction, and while <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>'s career output has been inconsistent, he has a terrific offensive supporting cast. If the front office makes a few additions to a defense that has struggled for years, the Lions can make a run at the NFC North crown.</p>\n<p><b>Cockcroft: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a>. The Lions were a surprisingly competitive team last season and are a sleeper contender for a deep playoff run depending upon how their draft and free agency run shakes out. They have two of the top 18 picks in the draft and a pretty solid salary-cap situation, so I'm curious to see what kinds of reinforcements they bring in as they attempt to take the next step.</p>\n<p><b>Miller: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Packers</a>. With the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35659836/aaron-rodgers-start-darkness-retreat-ahead-decision\">Rodgers saga</a>, the Packers are absolutely fascinating. Will he return? Do the Packers want to take another approach under center? Who would step up to take over for the 39-year-old quarterback if he is traded? The Packers have a major decision at that position that will no doubt shape what many other teams do as the dominos fall into place.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><b>Moody: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Texans</a>. While the Texans hit rock bottom offensively and defensively last season, DeMeco Ryans, another young <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35564183/sources-texans-hire-49ers-dc-demeco-ryans-head-coach\">former player turned coach</a>, makes them intriguing. As a former 49ers assistant coach, Ryan is bringing in pass-game coordinator Bobby Slowik and others from San Francisco's staff. So while it will be interesting to see who will be the Texans' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/houston-texans/post/_/id/26896/now-that-the-texans-have-hired-a-coach-what-will-they-do-to-fix-struggling-qb-position\">starting quarterback</a>, the good news is that Houston seems to be on the rise with a lot of talent already on the roster.</p>\n<p><b>Reid: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">49ers</a>. The 49ers have so much talent and depth, and Shanahan is as good as it gets with the X's and O's. If not for Purdy's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35559440/source-49ers-qb-brock-purdy-torn-ucl-right-elbow\">elbow injury</a> in the NFC Championship Game, the 49ers' season might have ended in Super Bowl LVII. They have uncertainty about only that one position, but if the 49ers get the QB room figured out, watch out.</p>\n<p><b>Tannenbaum:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">49ers</a>. It's all about the quarterback position, because you really can make an argument that any of Garoppolo, Purdy or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4383351/trey-lance\">Trey Lance</a> should be their starter. Garoppolo is a free agent again, but they brought him back last summer, and he ended up playing after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34618676/san-francisco-49ers-trey-lance-carted-ankle-injury-jimmy-garoppolo-comes-seattle-seahawks\">Lance's injury</a>. This is a fascinating situation.</p>\n<p><b>Walder: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Bears</a>. Roll your eyes all you want, but choosing whether to keep <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> and trade the No. 1 overall pick, or take another QB at No. 1 and trade Fields is a real decision. And it's a tough one. That choice will have massive ramifications and set the direction of the franchise for years to come.</p>\n<p><a name=\"breakout\"></a></p>\n<p><b>Yates:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Packers</a>. We don't know what's going to happen with Rodgers, but that decision could swing multiple teams' fortunes for 2023 and beyond. That, of course, includes the Packers. Beyond that, Green Bay has yet to make a decision this offseason on the fifth-year option for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036378/jordan-love\">Jordan Love</a>. It's not an easy one to make when he has hardly played.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Make your pick now: Who's going to have a breakout 2023 season?</h2>\n<p><b>Bell:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426388/jameson-williams\">Jameson Williams</a>, WR, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Lions</a>. The exciting rookie out of Alabama didn't make his season debut until Week 13 after recovering from a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=jameson+williams+ACL+reconstruction+espn&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS1026US1026&oq=jameson+&aqs=chrome.1.69i59l3j46i433i512j69i57j69i60l3.3461j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">torn ACL</a>, but he gave us a glimpse of what could be in Week 14 when he scored a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35232399/lions-first-rounder-jameson-williams-scores-41-yard-td-first-nfl-catch\">41-yard TD</a> against the Vikings in just his second NFL game. With more recovery time under his belt and a chance to work with the team through OTAs and training camp this year, Williams will be a star in a potent Lions offense.</p>\n<p><b>Bowen: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426354/george-pickens\">George Pickens</a>, WR, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Steelers</a>. Pickens has all the traits of a boundary receiver who can be isolated to win with his frame, ball skills and three-level ability. Given another year of development and with quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240703/kenny-pickett\">Kenny Pickett</a>, Pickens should play a difference-making role in '23. He had 801 receiving yards in his rookie campaign.</p>\n<p><b>Clay: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Bears</a>. This one feels like cheating after we saw Fields experience a minibreakout (certainly from a fantasy standpoint) during the 2022 season, but he's a candidate to make a giant leap in his third pro season. He has shown tremendous upside as a rusher (QB-high 1,143 rushing yards and 7.1 yards per carry in 15 games last season), but his supporting cast has not been particularly good and has led to underwhelming passing production and massive sack numbers (league-high 55 in 2022). With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4046692/chase-claypool\">Chase Claypool</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040655/darnell-mooney\">Darnell Mooney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258595/cole-kmet\">Cole Kmet</a> in place, and perhaps a few offseason additions coming, Fields will be better positioned to put it all together in 2023.</p>\n<p><b>Cockcroft: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence\">Trevor Lawrence</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars\">Jaguars</a>. Perhaps he's also too obvious after steering his team into the playoffs' second round as an NFL sophomore, but I think Lawrence has another significant step forward to make. And his strong finish to 2022 signals that's probably on the way in 2023. Lawrence has a solid set of receivers, and that's before considering the possibility that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\">Calvin Ridley</a> returns to give added depth.</p>\n<p><video3></video3></p>\n<p><b>Miller: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360939/rashod-bateman\">Rashod Bateman</a>, WR, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Ravens</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35658203/todd-monken-leaves-georgia-become-ravens-new-oc\">hiring of Todd Monken</a> to run the Ravens' offense was great news for Bateman. Monken, while the offensive coordinator at Georgia, set his wide receivers up for success with a ton of slants and inside routes. That's the specialty of Bateman, who has flashed WR1 potential. If healthy, he is primed for a 1,200-yard season.</p>\n<p><b>Moody: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426502/drake-london\">Drake London</a>, WR, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Falcons</a>. London is a huge receiver who can separate from defenders and make contested catches, and he will be one of the Falcons' most important players in 2023 with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239086/desmond-ridder\">Desmond Ridder</a> under center. In his past six games, London averaged 8.6 targets and 76.2 receiving yards, giving us a glimpse of what is to come.</p>\n<p><b>Reid: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4383351/trey-lance\">Trey Lance</a>, QB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">49ers</a>. After having <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35355869/niners-trey-lance-second-surgery-due-irritation-ankle\">multiple surgeries</a> on his right ankle, Lance is expected to be ready for OTAs. Purdy won't be, though, as he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35617339/sources-49ers-brock-purdy-set-elbow-surgery-feb-22\">recovers from elbow surgery</a>. Assuming the 49ers move on from Garoppolo, the path should be clear for Lance to be the team's Week 1 starter for the second straight season. Let's not forget that the 49ers traded up in the 2021 draft to take Lance third overall. With this roster, Lance could shine.</p>\n<p><b>Tannenbaum:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916148/tony-pollard\">Tony Pollard</a>, RB, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Cowboys</a>. Pollard made the Pro Bowl in 2022, but I expect him to level up even more next season, as Dallas could move on from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051392/ezekiel-elliott\">Ezekiel Elliott</a>. Pollard has a tremendous skill set and should burst onto the national scene behind a really good offensive line (when it's healthy).</p>\n<p><b>Walder: </b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052667/ogbonnia-okoronkwo\">Ogbonnia Okoronkwo</a>, DE, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Texans</a>. Okoronkwo flashed with a 19% pass rush win rate off the edge (13th-best) on a bad Houston team, yielding five sacks. He's a free agent now, and in a better situation where opponents are forced to pass more often and he's getting more playing time, he could have a late breakout.</p>\n<p><b>Yates:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360248/kyle-pitts\">Kyle Pitts</a>, TE, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Falcons</a>. All right, this might be a mayhem pick, but I'm trying to will it into existence. With improved quarterback play, there is simply no way that Pitts' production can be close to what it was in 2022 (just 356 yards and two TDs). I won't give up on a player with his raw talent, and I think a massive 2023 is in store.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"
