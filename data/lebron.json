  "<p>PHILADELPHIA -- Nobody has spent more time on an NBA court playing in games than <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>. Only James set the mark in the most lopsided loss of his career.</p>\n<p>James became the league's all-time leader in minutes played during the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584883\">138-94 loss</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia 76ers</a> on Monday. Taking into account both regular-season and postseason games, James has now played 66,319 minutes in his career, passing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/4145/kareem-abdul-jabbar\">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>'s total of 66,297 minutes.</p>\n<p>James' 30 minutes against the Sixers might have felt longer than usual, however, with Philadelphia outscoring L.A. by 30 points in the time the 38-year-old star was in the game.</p>\n<p>\"That doesn't mean much to me,\" James said when asked about the minutes mark.</p>\n<p>The 44-point loss -- the largest of James' 21-year career and tied for the fifth largest in Lakers history -- was far more pressing.</p>\n<p>James and the rest of L.A.'s main rotation players were pulled for good with 8:18 remaining in the fourth quarter and the Lakers already trailing by 27. James was asked whether he has thought about what needs to change with his team -- which is now 3-6 on the road and 10-8 overall -- to avoid defeats like Monday's moving forward.</p>\n<p>\"What needs to change in order for that not to happen again? Um, a lot,\" James said.</p>\n<p>Asked if there was anything in particular L.A. needed to focus on, he repeated: \"No. A lot.\"</p>\n<p>The Lakers trailed 32-19 at the end of the first quarter, digging an all-too-familiar early hole they would try to climb out of the rest of the contest.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"Feel like we just weren't together,\" Lakers big man <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> said. \"A lot of quick shots, one-pass shots, no-pass shots. They started making a lot of shots. And when their lead kind of opened up a little bit -- 15, 20, 25 -- I think we all tried to be the hero to make the team come back instead of just sticking with it.\"</p>\n<p>The Sixers made a season-best 22 3-pointers on 46 attempts (47.8%). L.A., meanwhile, was just 7-for-25 (25%) from deep.</p>\n<p>\"We got killed on the 3-point line today,\" James said bluntly.</p>\n<p>Lakers guard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> was more colorful in his description of what went wrong.</p>\n<p>\"I mean, they made a lot of 3s, we didn't, and they beat the s--- out of us,\" Reaves said. \"So, I don't know. Go back and watch this and get better.\"</p>\n<p>Davis said the team should \"flush\" the result from its memory -- pointing out that it has a road back-to-back against the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons\">Detroit Pistons</a> on Wednesday and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> on Thursday before it returns home -- but agreed with Reaves that a thorough film session would help to examine the loss.</p>\n<p>\"We've got to look at it, embrace it, own it,\" Davis said. \"Guys don't take it personal for whatever's said in the film, and then move on from it.\"</p>\n<p>Regular film sessions became a part of the Lakers' success under previous coach Frank Vogel but were sometimes volatile when a player or players took the instruction as a pointed attack rather than a teaching moment.</p>\n<p>\"You're sitting there and watching film ... it's also in front of the entire team, the coaching staff,\" Davis said. \"I don't think we have guys who probably will take it personal. But if they do, that's probably another conversation.\"</p>\n<p>Philadelphia was paced by reigning MVP <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid</a>, who logged a triple-double with 30 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, and got 31 points and eight assists out of fourth-year guard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4431678/tyrese-maxey\">Tyrese Maxey</a>.</p>\n<p>While several Lakers players mentioned the obvious injury absences the team continues to navigate -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278077/jarred-vanderbilt\">Jarred Vanderbilt</a> (heel), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> (knee), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395627/cam-reddish\">Cam Reddish</a> (groin) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura\">Rui Hachimura</a> (nasal fracture) were all unavailable against Philadelphia -- there was a shared sentiment that what L.A. mustered Monday was simply not good enough.</p>\n<p>And for a Lakers team coming off a Western Conference finals appearance and hoping to take the next step this season, it was a reminder that it hasn't looked anything like a contender so far.</p>\n<p>\"They have championship aspirations,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said of the Sixers. \"So do we. But in the short term, your competitive spirit has to be at a high level.\"</p>\n<p>When James was asked how a team should respond to a blowout like the Lakers suffered in Philadelphia, he offered a personal admission instead of any group instruction.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know how a team [should],\" he said. \"I can only speak for myself. ... I don't like it.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>CLEVELAND -- The arena's name might have changed, the locker room in which he slipped on his uniform might have been down the hall, and the signature headband look might have been replaced by a now easily identifiable graying beard, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> was playing basketball in Cleveland on Saturday night and winning.</p>\n<p>Same as it ever was.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> beat the host <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cavaliers</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584870\">121-115</a> to improve to 10-7 on the season.</p>\n<p>While it wasn't quite a vintage James performance -- 22 points on 8-of-23 shooting, including 1-of-9 from 3 -- he sealed the victory with two consecutive scores with under two minutes to go in the fourth quarter, getting a layup and a dunk to push Los Angeles' lead from one to five.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>And just like James kept coming at his former team, the 21-year NBA veteran keeps achieving in his career. So much so, in fact, that his charitable foundation opened up a museum -- LeBron James' Home Court -- on Saturday morning in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, to chronicle all the feats he continues to be responsible for.</p>\n<p>\"Spent 11 years here and being able to come back after my <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami</a> stint and win a championship here for this franchise, for this city, I think it was a 52-year [title] drought or something like that in the city of Cleveland for any sports team, I think that was just something that I will never forget no matter how old I get,\" James said. \"I'll always remember that moment.\"</p>\n<p>The Cavaliers organization did its part in treating James like an old friend rather than the night's opponent. Cleveland's mascot, Moondog, approached the Lakers' huddle to greet James with a fist pound when he was announced in the starting lineup. During a first-quarter timeout, the videoboard played a lengthy tribute to James' climb to the top of the NBA's all-time scoring list, with many in the 19,432 sellout crowd standing up to cheer the 38-year-old star when it was finished.</p>\n<p>\"Stepping back on this floor is always a pretty cool feeling, looking up there and pretty much being a part of all of the banners in this arena,\" James said. \"And the No. 1 banner, the one that sits in the middle, was that '16 championship, so that's pretty cool.\"</p>\n<p>It has been seven years since James led the Cavaliers to the first comeback from a 3-1 deficit in NBA Finals history to win it all. Cleveland upset the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a>, who were coming off a record-breaking 73-9 regular-season record and featured the first unanimous MVP in league history in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a>.</p>\n<p>James has hardly slowed down. He came into the night shooting a career-best 57.8% from the field, and he continues to play major minutes while Los Angeles deals with early-season injuries. As he admitted Saturday, \"We built this roster for myself and [<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>] to not to carry a huge load,\" because James wants to get this group moving in the right direction as best he can.</p>\n<p>The Lakers' effort against the Cavaliers was evidence that they might be able to sustain this success if and when James takes his foot off the gas to try to preserve some energy for another postseason run. The Lakers racked up 34 assists on 47 made field goals Saturday, and Davis led seven double-digit scorers for Los Angeles with a season-high 32 points.</p>\n<p>But there's still 65 games for the Lakers to figure all that out. They make just one trip a season to Cleveland, meaning there could be only a couple of more games left at his old stomping grounds in James' career -- barring a Lakers-Cavaliers matchup in the Finals before he hangs it up.</p>\n<p>\"It's just special,\" James said. \"It's very special to be a kid from Akron. I grew up 30 miles south of here, and to be able to be drafted here and spend my first seven years here and do some special things that the franchise had never seen. And when I was drafted, I said I wanted to light this place up like Vegas. So I feel like I did a decent job of doing that when I was here for my 11 years.\"</p>\n<p>Those 11 years he suited up for the Cavaliers along with the rest of James' journey will be commemorated for years to come at his new museum. General admission is $23, with the proceeds funding a training program for students, parents and educators that are a part of his I Promise School, located nearby in Akron. The museum features artifacts from his upbringing, including the oversize white suit he wore on draft night and game-worn sneakers from some of his biggest games. It is curated by his mother, Gloria James.</p>\n<p>\"I used to get on my mom a lot about saving everything since I was like starting first playing sports,\" James said. \"And she kind of threw it back in my face ... because a lot of the [items] in there is because of the stuff that she saved. And that's pretty cool.\"</p>\n<p>There will be more stat sheets for his mom to file away, more game balls to archive before he calls it quit, more clutch buckets like the ones he scored to put away the Cavaliers on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>But for the guy who has spent the past two decades going by his personal motto to \"strive for greatness,\" James allowed himself an evening at least to pause for reflection.</p>\n<p>\"I think it's pretty cool that I've been able to do some things in my life to be able to bring back to my community, continue to highlight my community and give my community a place where people want to visit, want to see and want to be proud of it,\" James said. \"And I am. I'm definitely proud of the fact that my foundation has been able to do some great things, and this is just one of the things that we can all be proud of, for sure, in my hometown.\"</p>\n\n",
  "<p>LOS ANGELES -- The night before <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> scored a season-high 37 points -- including the go-ahead free throw with 1.9 seconds left -- while logging 40 minutes to lead the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Lakers</a> over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584844\" target=\"_blank\">105-104</a> on Sunday, he had something to get off his chest.</p>\n<p>It was a rare evening off for the 38-year-old player, with his team in the middle of a stretch of six games in nine days, and he took a break from playing Madden NFL 24 to make a post to his Instagram story.</p>\n<p>He shared a graphic showing how his 35 points against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> on Friday was the 108th time he topped the 30-point plateau since signing with Los Angeles as a free agent in 2018.</p>\n<p>\"But I just came here to make movies though!\" James wrote, referring to derision he received when he made the move out of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland</a>. \"Ain't that what ya'll said right!?!?\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Why did he choose that moment to clap back at critics?</p>\n<p>\"Because sometimes you need to remind folks,\" James said Sunday after the win over the Rockets. </p>\n<p>He reminded his teammates he can still get up in the air, finishing a drive with a thunderous dunk midway through the fourth that put L.A. up by seven and caused Houston to call timeout.</p>\n<p>\"They've been joking about me, saying that I lay the ball up too much when I got an open lane,\" James said with a satisfied smile. \"So I'm trying to change that narrative, too.\"</p>\n<p>He reminded the armchair coaches who questioned why he would pass to an open <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395627/cam-reddish\">Cam Reddish</a> with the game on the line earlier in the season that he'll continue to find the open man in crunch time, as he did by setting up <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> for a go-ahead 3-pointer with 24.2 seconds left to put L.A. up 103-100.</p>\n<p>He reminded the Rockets' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155526/dillon-brooks\">Dillon Brooks</a>, who has <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story?_slug_=grizzlies-dillon-brooks-exchanges-words-lakers-lebron-james-poke-bears&id=36241210\" target=\"_blank\">become a willing agitator of his</a> in recent seasons, to rattle the cage at his own risk, as James scored 13 of his points in the fourth quarter on 5-of-6 shooting.</p>\n<p>\"That's competition,\" James said of Brooks, who, in the third quarter, caused a technical foul to be called on James by crowding his space and prompting an elbow and, in the fourth, prompted <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38849066/the-rise-too-small-nba-biggest-little-celebration\" target=\"_blank\">James to make a \"too small\" gesture</a> after scoring on him in the paint. \"Those young guys, they get me going. So, I need that.\" </p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>And James is reminding himself of why he continues to want to play in the NBA, with his financial future and career accomplishments already secured.</p>\n<p>\"Just trying to push the limit,\" he said. \"See how far I can take this thing. I don't know. I mean, it's me vs. Father Time.\"</p>\n<p>James is now up to 109 games with 30 or more points as a Laker, and he passed Lakers legend <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/110/kobe-bryant\">Kobe Bryant</a> on another historical list while doing so. James is up to 237 career games with 35 points or more, eclipsing Bryant's 236, to move into third all time, behind only <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4142/wilt-chamberlain\">Wilt Chamberlain</a> (381) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/1035/michael-jordan\">Michael Jordan</a> (333).</p>\n<p>James did it while shooting 14-of-19 from the field (73.7%), as he continued what would be the most efficient season he has ever played if he keeps it up. James is now shooting 58.6% overall for the season through 13 games, which is better than his best career year with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in 2013-14, when he shot 56.7%. His 39.7% from 3 isn't far off the career-best 40.6% he connected on with Miami in 2012-13, either.</p>\n<p>\"I have been able to be on the court a lot more during off days this year because of past injuries the last couple years with my foot or whatever the case may be,\" James told ESPN. \"So to be able to hone in on everything that I need to do instead of having to get off my foot, unless we're playing games has allowed me to stay in rhythm.</p>\n<p>\"I got my bounce back, my spring back, my quick twitch back and things of that nature.\"</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>He's got his spirit back, too, it would appear. After finishing his 20th season by being swept out of the playoffs by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> and openly contemplating retirement, and following that with a summer in which his eldest son, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4683774/bronny-james\">Bronny James</a>, suffered cardiac arrest, his joy for the game has been unmistakable this season.</p>\n<p>\"The one special thing about Bron is,\" Reaves said, \"I've never really seen him in a bad mood. He's always got energy. He's the oldest player in the NBA but still acts like he's 20 every day.\"</p>\n<p>He did it on Sunday with Bronny in the building hours after the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans\">USC</a> freshman was able to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/38941997/usc-bronny-james-warms-game-1st-season\" target=\"_blank\">participate in his team's pregame warmups</a> for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>\"I looked over at one point and saw Bronny sitting courtside, too, and I was like, 'OK, I got to turn it up a little bit even more,'\" James said.</p>\n<p>Turning it up and turning back time.</p>\n<p>\"He was outstanding,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. \"The LeBron we've all come to know and love over these 21 years.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

From his age-40 season to the end of his career, Brady threw for 193 touchdowns with a 65.6 completion percentage and won an MVP award.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Peyton Manning</h2>\n<p>Manning missed the entirety of the 2011 season after having neck surgery, and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts</a> moved on from him after that year. After signing with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a> in his age-36 season, he then demonstrated that the Colts might have been a bit premature in their decision.</p>\n<p>Over the final four seasons of his Hall of Fame career, Manning threw for 17,112 yards, 140 touchdowns and 53 interceptions. While injuries and inconsistency marred his final season, Manning would put it all together one more time in the playoffs to lead Denver to victory in Super Bowl 50.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>NBA</h2>\n<h2>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>\n<p>The Lakers Hall of Famer was still putting up significant numbers late into his career, averaging 23.4 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game in his age-38 season. He'd win three of his six rings after the age of 37, and would garner an NBA Finals MVP award in the 1984-85 contest.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>WNBA</h2>\n<h2>Sue Bird</h2>\n<p>Though she recently retired, Bird was a force even at the end of her long and storied career. She made the All-Star game in four of her final five seasons and led the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/sea/seattle-storm\">Seattle Storm</a> to WNBA titles in 2018 and 2020. Bird averaged 7.1 assists per game in her age-37 season, the highest single-season mark of her career.</p>\n<p><photo4></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/585/diana-taurasi\">Diana Taurasi</a></h2>\n<p>Taurasi has been a standout for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-mercury\">Phoenix Mercury</a> for a full 19 seasons, and she hasn't slowed down much at all in her later years. She made All-Star games in her age-36 and age-39 seasons, and averaged 16 points per game, 4.6 assists per game and 3.6 rebounds per game in her age-41 season.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>MLB</h2>\n<h2>Barry Bonds</h2>\n<p>In many ways, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants\">San Francisco Giants</a> slugger broke baseball. We all know that he hit 73 home runs in his age-36 season, setting off a streak of four straight MVP awards, but it was his age-39 season in 2004 which really beggared belief.</p>\n<p>Bonds had an on-base percentage of .609 that year, a full 140 points higher than the next-highest player (Todd Helton). Part of the reason for that was how terrified teams were to face him -- out of his 232(!) walks, 120(!!) of them were intentional. Even in his final season, at age 42, Bonds was sixth in the league in OPS with a 1.045 mark.</p>\n<p><photo5></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Willie Stargell</h2>\n<p>Pops was the heart and soul of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, and nowhere was this more apparent than in his late 30's. After an off-year in 1976 where his OPS fell to .797, Stargell roared back, posting three straight seasons with an OPS over .900.</p>\n<p>In 1979, Stargell hit 32 home runs and won the National League MVP award, but he saved his best for the postseason. Stargell hit .415 in the 1979 NLCS and World Series combined, with five home runs, six doubles and 13 RBI as he led the Pirates to an epic seven-game win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a>. He'd win both NLCS and World Series MVP honors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Hank Aaron</h2>\n<p>Hammerin' Hank might have been the most consistent player in baseball history, hitting about 40 home runs a year for almost all of his 23 seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a>. His age-37 season might have been his greatest at the plate, however, with a career-high 47 home runs and 1.079 OPS. He followed that up with 40 home runs and a 1.045 OPS at age 39. Aaron would break Babe Ruth's all-time home run record just a few games into the following season.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>David Ortiz</h2>\n<p>Ortiz's OPS declined from 1.066 in his age-31 season to .794 in his age-33 season, the kind of trend that signifies a swift retirement for hulking sluggers. He rebounded nicely, however, and his final seasons were some of the best of his career.</p>\n<p>Always a star in the World Series, Ortiz might have outdone himself in 2013, when he was 37 years old. He hit .688 with a 1.948 OPS on his way to winning World Series MVP. Even in his final season at age 40, Ortiz was still a force, leading the league in OPS (1.021), doubles (48) and RBI (127).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Nolan Ryan</h2>\n<p>Nolan Ryan and striking people out: name a better duo. That maxim remained true even in his 40's-- Ryan led the league in strikeouts every year from his age-40 to age-43 seasons. The Ryan Express would keep chugging along until he was 46 years old.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Roger Clemens</h2>\n<p>Clemens put on a power-pitching clinic as he entered his 40s. Clemens became the oldest-ever Cy Young winner in 2004, capturing the award a few months after he turned 42 by posting a 18-4 record with a 2.98 ERA. He might have been even better the next season, dropping his ERA to 1.97 and only giving up 6.4 hits per nine innings.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Randy Johnson</h2>\n<p>At an age when most pitchers are slowing down, Randy Johnson was just getting started. Over four seasons from age 35 to 38, he put up the following line: 81-27, a 2.48 ERA, 12.4 SO/9 and only 0.9 HR/9. Not surprisingly, he won the Cy Young award four straight times during that stretch. He'd add on a World Series title and MVP during his age-37 season in 2001.</p>\n<p>Though he'd never reach those heights again, his numbers from 39 to his retirement in his age-45 season (79-60, 3.91 ERA, 9 SO/9) are nothing to sneeze at.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Satchel Paige</h2>\n<p>Though we now know that Satchel Paige was 45 years old in 1952, folks at the time weren't quite sure of his exact birth date. Regardless, he was a force for the St. Louis Browns that season, throwing a league-leading 35 complete games, going 12-10 with a 3.07 ERA, and becoming the first Black pitcher to make an AL All-Star team.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, Paige would return for a one-game stint for the Kansas City Athletics in 1965, when he was 58 years old. He'd pitch three innings, striking out one and giving up a single hit, before walking off to a standing ovation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>NHL</h2>\n<h2>Wayne Gretzky</h2>\n<p>It's famously said that, if Gretzky had never scored a goal in the NHL, he'd still be No. 1 all-time in points based on assists alone. Even in the last few years of his career, The Great One could still find the open man. He led the league in assists in his age-36 and age-37 seasons, and was sixth in the league in his final year at 38.</p>\n<p><photo6></p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>PHOENIX -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> grimaced as he jogged with a slight limp to the visitors locker room at Footprint Center late Friday night.</p>\n<p>But not even a painful shin injury suffered in the first quarter could spoil this night for James, who had 32 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists to overcome <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> and lead the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584103\">122-119 in-season tournament victory</a> over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a>.</p>\n<p>James and Durant engaged in an epic duel with Durant finishing with 38 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. Durant scored seven points in the fourth, but James found <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395627/cam-reddish\">Cam Reddish</a> in the corner for an open 3 that gave the Lakers a 118-113 lead with 1:10 left that the Suns couldn't overcome.</p>\n<p>James also had to shake off an unintentional blow he took from Durant on a drive to the basket with 4:22 remaining in the first quarter when Durant's knee hit James in the left shin. James had to collect himself along the baseline for a moment before later getting his shin treated on the bench.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>He said the injury was sore after the game, and James could be seen walking with a slight limp. The Lakers play again Sunday against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> at home.</p>\n<p>\"It never loosened up,\" James said of the shin. \"[It] pretty much locked up right then and there. So I tried to keep my composure, make sure I was OK and try to keep it stretched out and as loose as possible and play the game and be effective.</p>\n<p>\"Pretty sore right now. Obviously because the adrenaline is calming down and iced it, now it's pretty sore.\"</p>\n<p>The Lakers (4-5) needed this win badly, not only because it was their first in-season tournament game but it also snapped a three-game losing streak on a four-game road trip.</p>\n<p>Coach Darvin Ham made a lineup change to try to spark the team, starting Reddish (17 points) and bringing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> off the bench for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>\"Everybody agreed that we needed to change up the music a little bit,\" Ham said. \"It wasn't a demotion for Austin. It was just a realignment. If anybody remembers those great <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio</a> teams where everyone in the world knew Manu [Ginobili] was a starter. But sometimes to balance out your lineup, you have to put a player of his magnitude in a reserve role so now when the starters go to sit down and take their break, you're not totally falling off a cliff. You have balance in the second unit.\"</p>\n<p>Reaves and Ham talked Thursday night about the move. The swingman responded by making 6 of 11 shots and finishing with 15 points and seven assists. Reaves had been a starter since March 22 of last season.</p>\n<p>\"I'm a competitor,\" Reaves said. \"Truthfully, don't want to have that conversation. Would love to have been playing better to not have those conversations, winning as a team. But my parents taught me at a young age that the coach is the coach. And his decision, regardless if you agree with it or don't agree with it, you respect that. That's what I did. We had good dialogue back and forth on what we thought we could do to be better as a unit. Winning is the main thing.</p>\n<p>\"I understand. I see the writing on the wall. I kind of seen it coming. I haven't played great. I've had games here and there. And as a team, we haven't played great. Obviously. On this road trip we were 0-3 until now. And [we] needed to shake things up.\"</p>\n<p>The Lakers made 12 of 27 3-point shots and came up with big second-chance efforts. On perhaps the biggest possession of the game, the Lakers got three offensive rebounds before James hit Reddish for the corner 3 to put them up five with 1:10 left.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles outscored Phoenix 33-23 and hit five triples in the fourth.</p>\n<p>\"I think it's the first time that we finally got over the hump as far as this road trip,\" James said. \"... We finally were able to make one of those momentum shots, and once that momentum shot opened, I felt like the floodgates started [early in the fourth] and then guys really started knocking them down.</p>\n<p>\"We've been playing from behind in a lot of our games and haven't been able to take the lead in some of the later games that we've lost. So that was a good feeling.\"</p>\n<p>At the end of the night, James, a huge Ohio State fan, also managed to get in a little dig at rival Michigan and football coach Jim Harbaugh when asked about Phoenix's defense.</p>\n<p>James couldn't resist a jab at Michigan and Harbaugh, who was handed a suspension for the remainder of the regular season from the Big Ten amid an ongoing NCAA investigation over alleged sign stealing.</p>\n<p>\"I think us having a knowledge of Coach [Frank] Vogel and his coaching staff,\" James said of the former Lakers coach when asked about playing against Phoenix's defense. \"We know that he's going to switch defenses up and he has a lot of defensive packages, a lot of schemes. So just about trying to read the game and see at what point, what the first quarter, second quarter, third, fourth, what are they in? We've got some history with Coach Frank, so we able to kind of have that blueprint and be able to steal some signals as well.</p>\n<p>\"So that was key to our success, and the best thing about tonight is that we were able to get those signals in [and] we still [are] able to play on Sunday. We don't get suspended like that team up North.\"</p>\n\n",
  "<p><video1></p>\n<p><strong>THE DAY BEFORE</strong> the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>' final preseason game, a few dozen children at the Pechanga Resort Casino in Temecula, California, were granted exclusive practice access, a rarity for a franchise that normally doesn't even allow reporters and news cameras in the gym until the group has already dispersed for individual free throw shooting.</p>\n\n\n<p>As the sponsored team appearance wound down, it was hard to miss the commotion caused when Lakers big man <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>, with his sneakers slung over his shoulder like Santa's toy sack, made his way to the group of kids as he walked off the court.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"AD! Anthony! Can I get your signature?! I got my Sharpie!\"</p>\n\n\n<p>What wasn't as noticeable was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3058254/christian-wood\">Christian Wood</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397077/jaxson-hayes\">Jaxson Hayes</a> flanking behind Davis, themselves looking a little like siblings waiting for their big brother.</p>\n\n\n<p>Without Davis insisting that vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers' front office find more post players to surround him as he plays out the $186 million contract extension he signed this summer, Wood and Hayes might not be in L.A.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>But, unless Davis can help indoctrinate the two free agent acquisitions to the point Lakers coach Darvin Ham trusts them at center, he could end up back at the 5 again, a position he has pushed back against since his very first day with the Lakers.</p>\n\n\n<p>Seeing the trio of big men together was a common occurrence during training camp. Davis, fondly recalling the camaraderie -- and interior effectiveness -- that he shared with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3452/javale-mcgee\">JaVale McGee</a> and Dwight Howard during the 2019-20 championship season, has intentionally tried to recreate that dynamic with Wood and Hayes.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I just try to be that leader,\" Davis told ESPN. \"Guys come over, sometimes we watch football ... bring the family, whatever. ... Just trying to do things like that just to show to the guys, like, 'I'm here for y'all. Whatever y'all need. My house is always open.'</p>\n\n\n<p>In a way, the Lakers' approach this season is a failsafe setup.</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Davis wants to play less center, so preparing Wood and Hayes to play minutes there will allow AD more time at power forward.</li>\n<li>Wood and Hayes, both inked to veterans minimum deals, want to take advantage of the Lakers' platform and up their market value -- and need playing time to do so.</li>\n<li>The Lakers want to win while also fostering their recent reputation that players can get paid after showing out in L.A. -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066262/malik-monk\">Malik Monk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032979/dennis-schroder\">Dennis Schroder</a> being the latest examples of that. As a luxury tax team limited by the new collective bargaining agreement, the Lakers need players on one-year deals to find success around their core to sustain their winning window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>If Wood and Hayes see consistent minutes at center because of their productivity -- and not because of Davis' absence because of an injury -- everybody gets what they want.</p>\n\n\n<p>Not to mention perhaps the most prescient reason to carry three centers in a league where small-ball, switchable and positionless basketball has become the default style of play. If the Lakers are going to reach their championship goal this season, they will likely have to overcome one, if not two, of the best big men in basketball along the way: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic\">Nikola Jokic</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo\">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia 76ers</a>, who have combined to win five of the past six MVP awards and two of the past three Finals MVP distinctions.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Trying to stay as close as possible,\" Davis said of his plans for Wood and Hayes this season. \"Just reminiscing on how close we were, the things we did in '20 when we won.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>THE CONCESSION BY</strong> Ham to limit Davis' minutes at center as the coach begins his second year on the Lakers' sideline is a significant one, the first thing that needed to happen to prove the organization is truly a willing collaborator with its stars. The Lakers acted on Davis' offseason input, landing two-year deals with both <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37943675/sources-lakers-agree-2-year-deal-jaxson-hayes\">Hayes, in July</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38336475/christian-wood-los-angeles-lakers-reach-2-year-deal\">Wood, in September</a>. (Each has a player option for the second year.)</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I don't get caught up in it,\" Ham told ESPN when asked about the continuing back and forth between Davis and the team's decision-makers about his preferred position. \"I know what he means about wanting to have his skill set be diversified on the floor. I get that part, and we are on the same page.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>It's not that Davis will abandon the position. He has still started at center in every game he has played this season, because he's still by far the Lakers' best option there. But L.A. has already closed some games with Davis and Wood sharing the court, showing their commitment to Davis' vision.</p>\n\n\n<p>Davis played almost exclusively at center last season while helping lead the Lakers to the Western Conference finals, posting career bests in rebounds (12.5 per game) and field goal percentage (56.3%) to go with 25.9 points and 2.0 blocks per night.</p>\n\n\n<p>But L.A. was swept by the eventual-champion Nuggets, led by one of the most skilled bigs in league history in Jokic. While Davis recorded elite averages of 26.8 points and 14 rebounds per game in the series, Jokic ran roughshod on L.A.'s fifth-ranked playoff defense, posting 27.8 points, 14.5 rebounds and 11.8 assists per game.</p>\n\n\n<p>It was a stark contrast to the 2020 West finals in the Orlando, Florida, bubble, when Davis outdueled the two-time MVP with 31.2 points to Jokic's 21.8 points and the Lakers won in five games.</p>\n\n\n<p>There's no mistaking Jokic's improvement over the past several years, and Davis' first year in L.A. still stands out as his most complete since joining the Lakers. But something else changed between 2020 and 2023: L.A.'s roster construction.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>With Davis, McGee and Howard together, the Lakers led the league in blocks per game and were seventh in field goal percentage allowed at the rim, according to Second Spectrum tracking.</p>\n\n\n<p>In three seasons since, with Davis suffering major injuries and the Lakers cycling through centers Marc Gasol, Montrezl Harrell, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064559/damian-jones\">Damian Jones</a> (twice), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6585/andre-drummond\">Andre Drummond</a>, Howard again, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3442/deandre-jordan\">DeAndre Jordan</a>, Wenyen Gabriel, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934723/thomas-bryant\">Thomas Bryant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277919/mo-bamba\">Mo Bamba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6474/tristan-thompson\">Tristan Thompson</a>, L.A. has ranked ninth in blocks per game and 23rd, 28th and 17th, respectively, in rim protection, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.</p>\n\n\n<p>Considering Davis, Hayes and Wood's preexisting ties, maybe they'll be the right three to turn those numbers around.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>DAVIS' FINAL GAME</strong> for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a> happened to be Wood's first.</p>\n\n\n<p>It was March 24, 2019, and both big men were at career crossroads. Davis was two months removed from requesting a trade and initially being pulled from the lineup for nine games before awkwardly suiting back up for the team that had drafted him No. 1 when no deal was struck by the deadline. Wood was signed off waivers with eight games remaining in the regular season, with the Pelicans taking a flyer on the undrafted big man out of UNLV who had cycled through three NBA teams in three years.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I've always been a big fan of AD,\" the 28-year-old Wood told ESPN about the 30-year-old Davis. \"Even before I got to New Orleans, I was always watching his game. I always thought we had similarities in our game.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"So, when we met each other, I was instantly like, 'Let's play one-on-one.' Let's do this, let's do that. 'Where can I learn from you?' Where can I get better at?'\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Wood and Davis remain close five years later. \"Who, 'Twin'?\" Davis asked, interrupting an interview with Wood. \"This is Twin right here.\"</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>While their dynamic is playful -- they are often seen prodding each other over who is the better shooter -- Davis assumes a disciplinary role, too. During L.A.'s second preseason game last month against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn Nets</a> in Las Vegas, Davis didn't like the effort he was seeing from Wood.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I got on him in Vegas,\" Davis said. \"I was telling him just, 'You use this time to catch a rhythm. We're not going through the motions.'</p>\n\n\n<p>\"And he didn't take it personal, he just took it with him like, 'All right, cool.' And he scored like eight straight [points] after that. So I'm just trying to see what motivates him, what pushes him.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I'm telling him if you want to take your game to the next level, get that contract that you want, this is [the consistency needed] every day.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Hayes was acquired from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks</a> by the Pelicans on draft night in 2019 by trading the No. 4 pick the Lakers sent to New Orleans as part of the package to get Davis. When Hayes arrived to the Pelicans, he was learning the ropes by being asked to play inside the way Davis had for the franchise.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>\"We still had Alvin [Gentry], who was Ant's coach,\" Hayes told ESPN. \"So we still ran all the same stuff pretty much. So they just would show me a lot of Ant film so I could just go out and try to emulate that and be that for us my rookie year.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Davis has taken Hayes under his wing, too.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's an exceptional talent,\" Davis said of Hayes. \"Very athletic. Can protect the rim. Runs the floor, he plays hard. He listens. He wants to get better. And that's all you can ask for.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's constantly asking me questions. And I get on him as well. Like, 'Running back in transition, your job is to clean up the entire paint. Nobody should ever score in the paint.'\"</p>\n\n\n<p>And Ham has introduced a new offense this season that could allow all three big men to thrive, often with two of them sharing the floor -- a system that just so happened to be used when the Lakers had those three big men who were all impactful in 2020.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>ONE WEEK INTO</strong> the season, facing an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> team that came into the night riding an 11-game game winning streak against its city rival, it wasn't the Lakers' new \"five out\" offense that was troubling them.</p>\n<p>The Lakers allowed 61 points and were trailing by 13 after one half, and the Clippers were pounding them in the paint and hounding them on the boards.</p>\n\n\n<p>Worse still, Ham played <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> nearly 20 minutes through the first two quarters, eating into the guidelines he and the medical staff established to try to keep the 21-year veteran as fresh as possible come the postseason.</p>\n<p>Still trailing by double digits midway through the third and looking for a spark, Ham subbed in Wood for James. A minute later, Ham swapped in Hayes for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395627/cam-reddish\">Cam Reddish</a>.</p>\n<p>Once the two bigs joined Davis on the court, the supersized group -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432582/max-christie\">Max Christie</a> were the other two players in the lineup -- wreaked havoc on the Clips.</p>\n<p>\"The size messes everyone up defensively because it's just way more arms everywhere, more people in the way,\" Hayes told ESPN. \"I really like that group just because of size. But I mean, that's coming from me as a big. If you ask a guard, they probably don't like that group as much.\"</p>\n<p>The Clippers guards certainly couldn't have appreciated it. The Lakers outscored the Clippers by 15 and outrebounded them by 10 in the quarter.</p>\n<p>After several sequences featuring contested shots, when <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george\">Paul George</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> would use a pump fake to elude Hayes or Wood, only to have Davis as the next obstacle -- the big mens' defensive imprint tightened the game, which the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584755\">Lakers would eventually win in overtime</a>.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>The offense showed signs of clicking, too.</p>\n<p>The offense doesn't just refer to whomever is playing the 5 being spaced out on the perimeter, but all five players on the court. The goal is to have wing players sprint to the corners at the start of offensive possessions, drawing defensive attention, which in turn gives more space to operate the offense from the top of the key when a trailing big man -- in the Lakers' case, Davis -- orchestrates the action.</p>\n<p>With the Clippers' lead down to four points with a tick under two minutes remaining in the third quarter, Reaves dribbled up the left wing while Davis, at the top of the key, motioned to Wood to evacuate the left corner.</p>\n<p>Wood curled through the lane and spotted up on the right wing beyond the 3-point line, while Davis dove toward the hoop after setting a slip screen for Reaves. The movement made Wood's defender, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3033/pj-tucker\">P.J. Tucker</a>, turn his head toward Davis for a split second, creating just enough time for Reaves to find Wood with a pass beyond the arc that he stepped into, launching a 3 to bring the Lakers within one and prompting the Clippers to call timeout as the Crypto.com Arena crowd erupted.</p>\n<p>Davis controlled the action without even touching the ball. And plenty more options materialize when he does.</p>\n<p>\"With more than capable 3-point shooters on both sides,\" Ham said, \"[Davis] can go weak side, strong side or just have [his four teammates] occupy the defense while he goes and tries to bring down his own man.\"</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Besides saving Davis' body from the wear and tear that would accompany an offense that requires him to plant himself near the lane and constantly fight for post-up positioning, five out appeals to the eight-time All-Star's cerebral side.</p>\n<p>\"His versatility on both sides of the ball will definitely be explored,\" Ham said. \"There'll be times where he's like a [point guard] because he is initiating our offense from the trail position. We got sets where he's the initiator with the ball in his hand.\"</p>\n<p>Injuries to Davis (left hip spasms) and Hayes (left ankle sprain) on L.A.'s 1-3 road trip have kept Ham from getting to the three-big lineup more. Early injuries have thrown much of the Lakers' plans out of whack, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> (left knee swelling) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278077/jarred-vanderbilt\">Jarred Vanderbilt</a> (left heel bursitis) both continuing to miss time. And James is now dealing with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38882613/lakers-lebron-james-calf-contusion-miss-first-game-season\">a left calf injury</a> that caused him to miss L.A.'s game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Whatever temporary scramble is necessary to try to keep the team above water doesn't mean the Lakers are abandoning their big-picture approach. They're not \"throwing the baby out with the bath water,\" as Ham likes to say.</p>\n<p>And if adding centers to the roster was a way to placate Davis, relying on an equal-opportunity playmaking offense like five out is a way to protect James, too. The more others are relied on to shoulder the offensive responsibilities, the less stress will be on the 38-year old to carry them.</p>\n<p>Because, if the Lakers can keep James healthy, he's someone teams like Denver and Milwaukee can't claim: an all-time great with 10 Finals runs under his belt to propel the playoff push.</p>\n<p>It's the Lakers' big plan this season. Starting with three big men.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Through eight games, the Lakers have been outscored by 74 points in first quarters, which is the worst margin through eight games in NBA history, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. They also have been historically bad from the 3-point line: They're the first club to make fewer 3 and shoot a worse percentage from 3 than their opponent in each of their first eight games.</p>\n<p>\"We're juggling different circumstances -- guys being in and out of the lineup,\" Ham said. \"But at the end of the day, no one is going to feel sorry for you, especially when you're a Los Angeles Laker.\"</p>\n<p>The bind the Lakers find themselves in naturally prompted the question: What can be done to turn things around for a team that openly spoke about championship aspirations during training camp?</p>\n<p>\"I think we just need to relax and figure out where the root of where we're going to start trending in the right direction,\" Lakers point guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/dangelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a> said. \"And I think getting healthy first is one.

Two of the refs said they were blocked and they didn't see it.\"</p>\n<p>Lakers coach Darvin Ham was assessed his first technical foul of the season -- and just the third of his career -- with 39 seconds remaining in the third quarter for arguing the non-call against James.</p>\n<p>\"I see Bron shooting four free throws,\" Ham said after the game, \"and the amount of times he attacked the rim, the amount of times he was slapped on the arm, which I could see plain as day, for that not to be called, man ... he's not flopping.

Sometimes not even at all, which is weird.\"</p>\n<p>James has attempted four free throws or fewer in three of the Lakers' seven games this season, including four in Monday's game in Miami.</p>\n<p>\"So just got to keep driving, keep putting pressure on the rim and see if it turns,\" James said. \"But we had some tough break calls tonight for sure, and not in our favor tonight.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>MIAMI -- With his former team's \"Heat Culture\" slogan painted at half court in front of him as he rested on a baseline seat after shootaround Monday, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> reflected on what his time with the franchise meant to his career that has now spanned more than two decades.</p>\n<p>\"I think I would still be at this level no matter if I would've came here or not,\" said the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> star, now in his 21st season, said. \"Let's not get it twisted: The four years I was here, it was amazing. I loved everything about it. Loved this franchise, this franchise is top tier, it's one of the best franchises in the world.</p>\n<p>\"But as far as my career, my career was going to be my career as far as individually, because I know how much I put into the game and I know how much I strived to be as great as I can be. [But] as far as what I was able to learn here was second to none, that's for sure.\"</p>\n<p>James was 25 years old when he arrived in South Beach in 2010. He had zero championships, two MVPs and one NBA Finals appearance to his name through his first seven seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>. By the time he left Miami in 2014, he had boosted those totals to two titles, four MVPs, five trips to the Finals and two Finals MVPs, and he was instrumental in the Heat reeling off 27 straight wins in 2012-13 -- the second-longest win streak in league history.</p>\n<p>\"I came here for one reason and one reason only, and that was to win championships,\" James said. \"That was my only goal. That was the only reason I teamed up with [Dwyane] Wade and [Chris] Bosh. Because I felt like I couldn't do it in Cleveland. We couldn't. ... I tried to recruit guys to come to Cleveland. I tried to go and help the upstairs and it wasn't happening. So I had an opportunity to be a free agent so I did what I thought was best, not only for my career but for me at that point in time.\"</p>\n<p>James said it was a formative time in his life, not only in his career, as he uprooted himself from the only home he'd ever known in Northeast Ohio to settle in South Florida.</p>\n<p>\"It was a culture change for me,\" James said. \"People talk about 'Heat Culture' -- it was a culture change, period. I was changing everything about my life for the first time in my life. To be able to be here and be able to learn and be alongside D-Wade, UD [Udonis Haslem] and Spo [Erik Spoelstra] -- those guys who had won it already -- it definitely was great to be a part of, for sure.\"</p>\n<p>Miami will don its City Edition uniforms when it hosts the Lakers, with \"Heat Culture\" stitched on the jerseys to complement the specialized court it will play on that includes a message painted in block letters in the lane: \"Hardest working. Best conditioned. Most professional. Unselfish. Toughest. Meanest. Nastiest team in the NBA.\"</p>\n<p>James, who put the Heat on a short list of what he considers to be the model franchises across all sports -- including the Lakers and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a> in the NBA and Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots in the NFL -- said a strong team culture can only exist if players buy in.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously, it starts from the top, but at the end of the day it's the guys that are in the locker room holding guys accountable,\" he said. \"You can have the messaging come from the top, but if guys are not abiding by it or doubling down on it in the locker room and then applying it on the floor and applying it off the court and being model citizens, or whatever the case may be, then it still doesn't matter.\"</p>\n<p>It was not the first time James evoked the Steelers this season. When the Lakers started off their road trip with a 120-101 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a> on Saturday to drop to 3-3, he likened L.A.'s early-season seesaw to Pittsburgh's performance.</p>\n<p>\"We're like the Pittsburgh Steelers right now,\" James said. \"The Pittsburgh Steelers right now have not outgained or outscored any of their opponents in this season right now, and yet they got a winning record.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, Pittsburgh is 5-3 but has been outscored 163-133 overall and has accumulated 2,228 yards on offense while allowing 3,018 yards on defense. Similarly, the Lakers are .500 but they've been outscored by 61 points in the first quarter -- the worst points differential through six games by any team since the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons\">Detroit Pistons</a> in 1964-65. L.A. also ranks 29th in 3-point percentage (29.7%) and 28th in both catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage and wide-open 3-point percentage, according to data compiled from Second Spectrum.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>LOS ANGELES -- Halfway through overtime in the Los Angeles Lakers' 130-125 win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> on Wednesday -- with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>' playing time already nearing the 40-minute mark -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> had a decision to make.</p>\n<p>Storming up the court on a fastbreak, having just stolen the ball from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a>, Reaves could try to finish at the basket himself or involve his 38-year-old teammate.</p>\n<p>\"At no point after I got that ball did I think I was going to shoot it,\" Reaves said. \"I saw him and I was going to pass it the whole way.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>It wasn't just any pass. Reaves threw an alley-oop over his shoulder, and the hard-charging James dunked it home to put the Lakers up by five with 2:12 to go. It prompted the Clippers to call a timeout and sent the crowd into a tizzy.</p>\n<p>\"I have a sense that I can just throw it anywhere and he'll go get it,\" Reaves said of James. \"That's the crazy part with how long he's been playing.\"</p>\n<p>Added James, after finishing with 35 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists in 42 minutes: \"I'm just happy I'm still able to go get it at this point in my career. I mean, he trusted me to go get it, so I wanted to go up there.\"</p>\n<p>The dunk capped a dominant finish to the game for the four-time MVP, who was instrumental in the Lakers snapping an 11-game losing streak against the Clippers by scoring 14 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, going 6-for-8 from the field in doing so.</p>\n<p>\"I mean, he took over,\" Lakers guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/dangelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a> said of James. </p>\n<p>The win lifted the Lakers' record to 3-2, and James continued coming up clutch in late-game situations. He has scored 51 points (10.2 points per game) in the fourth quarter and overtime this season, shooting a blistering 21-for-31 from the field (68%).</p>\n<p>\"If we keep the game close, I feel like in the fourth quarter, that's when I'm at my best,\" James said. \"If the game is close, I can make plays to help us win the ballgame, no matter who is out on the floor for us.\"</p>\n<p>While L.A. has been hit by the injury bug early, with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990962/taurean-prince\">Taurean Prince</a> (left knee soreness) becoming a late scratch Wednesday and joining <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura\">Rui Hachimura</a> (concussion protocol), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> (left knee swelling) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278077/jarred-vanderbilt\">Jarred Vanderbilt</a> (left heel bursitis) on the mend, James has picked up the slack.</p>\n<p>\"He's been phenomenal down the stretch,\" said <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>, who had another strong outing in his own right with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks. \"I think [the coaching staff is] kind of banking minutes early on and then letting [James] just kind of flow throughout the fourth quarter.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, the caveat that accompanies the late-game brilliance has been James routinely breezing through the team's playing time guideline of limiting him to 28-30 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Through five games, James has averaged 35.6 minutes, a slight uptick from the 35.5 he played last season. As Lakers coach Darvin Ham has more options available to him, he will pare down James' playing time, as was the goal, to keep him as fresh as possible for the playoffs.</p>\n<p>For now, the team is content finding its footing by having James taking them home.</p>\n<p>\"He doesn't prepare to just be available and be another body on the floor,\" Ham said. \"He prepares to be at a high, high level. Not only available, but available and elite. So kudos to him.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

It pretty quickly proved flexible, as Lakers coach Darvin Ham played James 35 minutes in the Lakers' first win over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a> and 39-plus minutes in Sunday's overtime loss in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>Less discussed has been James' step back on offense. He attempted just eight shots in the first three quarters against the Suns and is below a 30% usage overall, which would be James' lowest mark since his rookie season. In the context of James saying at media day that teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38551383/lebron-james-says-anthony-davis-face-lakers-franchise\">\"the face\" of the Lakers' franchise</a>, is this a sign of him relinquishing some control of the offense after posting a 33% usage rate -- James' highest since his first stint with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> -- last season?</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>As the chart of his average season-to-date usage rate through each game of the schedule across his career shows, James has historically tended to ease into the season in terms of a heavy usage load, allowing teammates to carry a heavier share early in the schedule. His usage rate was even lower (28%) through the first three games of the 2021-22 season, and in the same ballpark five games into his first season with the Lakers (2018-19). James ended both campaigns with his customary 30%-plus usage rate. I'd expect the same this time around.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Mostly real: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433255/chet-holmgren\">Chet Holmgren</a>'s fast start</h2>\n\n\n<p>Overshadowed by the totally understandable hoopla over No. 1 pick <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a>, Holmgren has been the league's best rookie thus far after sitting out his first pro season with a Lisfranc injury. Joining an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> team that reached the play-in a year ago, Holmgren has had an easier landing and, at 21, is also 20 months older than 19-year-old Wembanyama.</p>\n<p>From the jump, Holmgren -- playing exclusively at center -- has proved the perfect complement to the Thunder's core of young perimeter talent that was missing a big man last season. Entering play Wednesday, Holmgren led the NBA by blocking 8% of opponent 2-point attempts. That should come as no surprise as Holmgren was a top-10 shot-blocker in his lone NCAA season at Gonzaga and ranked sixth among players who saw at least 50 minutes of preseason action with a 10% block rate.</p>\n<p>Because he's playing center, Holmgren has been in position to contest more shots than Wembanyama. According to Second Spectrum tracking on NBA Advanced Stats, Holmgren had averaged 10.8 shots defended inside 5 feet, the league's third-highest mark. Defending largely on the perimeter, Wembanyama has averaged 3.5 shots defended inside 5 feet.</p>\n<p>Holmgren surely won't continue to hit 62.5% of his 3-point attempts, as he did over his first four games (he went 1-for-5 from 3 during the Thunder's fifth game of the season on Wednesday), but his defensive impact is real -- and spectacular.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<h2>Not real: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277905/trae-young\">Trae Young</a>'s poor shooting</h2>\n\n\n<p>It's been a rough go for Young, who hit 8 of 35 shots (23%), including 3-of-14 (21%) from 3-point range, as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks</a> started 0-2. Even as the Hawks got in the wins category by beating the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a> on Sunday, Young was still off at 5-of-14.</p>\n<p>According to Second Spectrum's quantified shot probability metric (qSP), which considers distance and type of shot as well as location of nearby defenders and the shooter's ability, Young is getting just as good shots as last season. So, his qSP is an expected effective field-goal percentage (eFG%) of 49% after accounting for the added value of 3-point shots -- same as last season.</p>\n<p>Young's actual 33% eFG% is the product of atypically poor shot making. The difference between his expected and actual eFG%, which Second Spectrum calls quantified shot-making (qSM), is the lowest mark among players with at least 70 shot attempts. Expect his shooting to regress to an All-Star mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n\n<h2>Real: The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics\">Boston Celtics</a>' start</h2>\n<p>That the Celtics started 4-0 isn't terribly surprising. After adding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3995/jrue-holiday\">Jrue Holiday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis\">Kristaps Porzingis</a> this offseason, Boston was my pick to win the title and easily had the best wins projection of any team in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story?id=38503924&_slug_=nba-preview-2023-24-win-projections-all-30-teams\">my stats-based model</a>.</p>\n<p>It is impressive that the Celtics won a pair of games despite hot opposing shooting. Before Monday's blowout win against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-wizards\">Washington Wizards</a>, opponents were hitting a league high 45% of 3s against Boston: 44% for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> in the season opener and 48.5% for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in a conference finals rematch. Last season, teams went just 120-371 (.244) when opponents made at least 43% of their 3s. The Celtics were 3-6 in that situation, meaning their two wins so far nearly already match their entire 2022-23 total.</p>\n<p>If anything, how well opponents shot simply gave Boston the ability to win close games down the stretch, showcasing what the Celtics hope will be different this season.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Not real: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a>' strong defense</h2>\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal\">Bradley Beal</a> yet to play and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a> sitting out the past three games, the Suns haven't yet been the offensive juggernaut we expected while scoring at a league-average rate. They still won two of their first three games, thanks to a top-five defensive rating. Is this a case of new coach Frank Vogel importing the defensive culture he brought to the Lakers during his first season, which resulted in the 2019-20 championship? Not likely.</p>\n<p>Phoenix has benefited from the league's worst shot-making by opponents. Based on qSP, we'd expect teams to post a 54% eFG% against the Suns thus far, the league's third-highest mark. Instead, their actual 44.5% eFG% is third-lowest in the NBA. The Lakers and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> combined to shoot just 15-of-72 (21%) from 3-point range against Phoenix, and when the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a> finally became the first Suns opponents to make even a third of their 3s (14-of-37, 38%), they pulled off a late upset Tuesday in the desert.</p>\n<p>Once Beal and Booker are back, Phoenix should be able to score enough to overcome the inevitable defensive regression.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>SACRAMENTO -- There was a framed photo resting on the floor next to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>' locker when he arrived on Sunday. The anniversary gift from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> showed James, as an 18-year-old rookie, skying in for a right-handed hammer dunk during his NBA debut 20 years ago against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings</a>.</p>\n<p>James managed to turn back the clock two decades later for a nearly identical breakaway slam late in the Lakers' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401584728\">132-127 overtime loss</a> to the Kings.</p>\n<p>\"It's pretty special I'm still doing it and I'm playing the game that I love,\" James said. \"To have a breakaway ... some pretty cool correlation, for sure.\"</p>\n<p>The Lakers included a bottle of wine as part of the gesture -- a 2003 vintage, naturally, of Celler Vall Llach.</p>\n<p>However, if James planned to open it and pour a few glasses on the flight back to L.A., it wouldn't be to drown his sorrows after the Kings defeat dropped the Lakers to 1-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>\"I like the way [we played],\" James said after L.A. came back to force the extra session after trailing by as many as 15. \"We had some moments tonight. We had some really good moments tonight. We just weren't able to pull it out the way we would have liked to.\"</p>\n<p>James' night wasn't perfect by any means. Two of his game-high eight turnovers came in overtime. Big picture, however, that he put up 27 points on 11-for-19 shooting, 15 rebounds and 8 assists playing in the 1,424th regular-season game of his career -- similar, if not better numbers, than the 25 points on 12-for-20 shooting, 6 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals and 2 turnovers he registered in Game No. 1 -- provides plenty to be encouraged about when considering the Lakers' chances with James leading them this season.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Lakers coach Darvin Ham, who saw his team stumble out of the gates to a 2-10 start last season, was similarly optimistic.</p>\n<p>\"We did a lot of great things out there tonight,\" Ham said after James and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> [30 points, 16 rebounds] became the first Lakers teammates since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in 2002 to go for 25 points and 15 boards in the same game. \"Definitely, some things we need to work on. Some things I need to tighten up.\"</p>\n<p>When asked to elaborate, Ham pointed to his responsibility to iron out his rotation sooner than later.</p>\n<p>\"My rotation, we got to really dig into that,\" Ham said. \"Really take a close look and so guys are in rhythm. We have a great collection of players. And I played in this league. When you know when you're going in and who you're playing with, that matters. So buckling down on our rotation, I'll start there. That definitely is the main thing that's on my mind.\"</p>\n<p>Davis protected his coach, reasoning that Ham has had to juggle the absence of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278077/jarred-vanderbilt\">Jarred Vanderbilt</a>, a starter on last year's team, because of bursitis in his left heel, while also starting to integrate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> after the free agent acquisition missed a chunk of the preseason with lower back tightness.</p>\n<p>Plus, no rotation adjustment could help that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> (1-for-12) suffered through one of his worst shooting nights. Or change the outcome of overtime when the Kings shot 3-for-7 from 3 while the Lakers went 1-for-4, swinging the game's direction.</p>\n<p>\"I think we're in a good rhythm collectively,\" Davis said. \"I don't think that's much of an issue. ... It'll come. We just got to continue to fight like we did tonight. Obviously, we wanted to win, but got another one tomorrow. Just put it all together, keep pushing and it'll turn for us.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps adding some urgency to Ham's remarks was that he blew through the team's minutes guideline for James, playing him 39 minutes in the loss, with the second night of a back-to-back on the schedule for Monday at home against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously, I don't want to run Bron into the ground,\" Ham said. \"I don't want to run [Davis] into the ground too early. Obviously, it was an overtime game tonight and they're playing at a high level, so you want to leave them out there. But just having that balance.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>LOS ANGELES -- Down a dozen heading into the fourth quarter and facing an 0-2 start to the season barring a comeback against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a>, Lakers coach Darvin Ham had a decision to make: stick to the 30-minute guideline planned for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebronjames\">LeBron James</a>' playing time and have him on the court only about half the final frame or push the limit and see if the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Lakers</a> could ride the 21-year veteran to victory.</p>\n<p>Ham chose the latter. James nearly outscored the Suns singlehandedly while playing the entire fourth quarter, and the Lakers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584704\">won 100-95</a> to bounce back from a disappointing opening loss in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver</a>.</p>\n<p>\"He asked me if I could go the [whole] quarter, and I looked at the time and the score and what was going on in the game, and it was an easy answer for myself,\" James said after finishing with 21 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds in 35 minutes. \"I know how much work I've put in to be able to play quarters or whatever the case may be. And I understand that we definitely have a system put in place, but tonight called for me to go outside the box.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The Lakers outscored the Suns 28-11 in the fourth, with James scoring 10 points, including four straight on consecutive layups to break a 91-91 tie and give Los Angeles a four-point cushion with 41.0 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>To help build in some extra rest for the 38-year-old star, Ham saved three timeouts for the fourth. He called one with 4:55 remaining, another with 3:07 left, and the Lakers were gifted two more breaks by the Suns. Former Lakers coach Frank Vogel used a challenge to overturn an out-of-bounds call with 2:19 remaining and called for time with 26.6 seconds left to set up an offensive possession.</p>\n<p>\"We were dragging our feet there for the better part of the first half, and things weren't clicking,\" Ham said. \"He has that spirit, that intensity to put the team on his shoulders. And I had timeouts to play with. And so I went to him, I said, 'How we feeling? What do we want to do?' And he answered my question. And you guys saw the results. So we used a couple of our timeouts to get some breathers.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> was right there with James helping Los Angeles complete the comeback. Davis had 13 of his team-high 30 points in the fourth quarter, also finishing with 12 rebounds, 3 steals and 3 blocks.</p>\n<p>It was a better showing for Davis, who went scoreless in the second half in the Lakers' loss to the defending champion Nuggets on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>During his on-court postgame interview with the TNT broadcast, James was adamant in his dismissal of critiques about Davis' performance.</p>\n<p>\"We don't give a s--- about criticism about AD,\" James said. \"We don't care. Nothing bothers us. AD doesn't care. I don't know if guys have figured that out. AD does not care. He's not on social media, so he doesn't see none of the crap. He rarely talks, unless it's to us, so we don't give a s--- about it, and he definitely doesn't. He just goes out and does his job, and we're happy to have AD.\"</p>\n<p>True to form, Davis didn't even mention his individual offensive output when asked about the Lakers' fourth-quarter performance, instead focusing on the team's defensive effort.</p>\n<p>\"Just being able to get stops and rebound,\" Davis said after the Lakers held the Suns to 5-for-20 shooting to close it out. \"That's it. We have enough on the floor offensively to score the basketball. ... Just wanted to lock in defensively. Especially when you got a guy like [<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>] going, just making it tough for him. And then just make sure the other guys don't beat you. That's what we tried to do.\"</p>\n<p>Durant, playing without fellow Suns stars in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a> (sore foot) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal\">Bradley Beal</a> (sore lower back), led all scorers with 39 points and moved past Hakeem Olajuwon for No. 12 on the career scoring list in the process.</p>\n<p>\"We don't have many matchups left,\" James said after he and Durant played their first regular-season game against each other since Christmas Day in 2018. \"Not sure how many we have left so. So you don't ever want to take it for granted when you're out there with such a great player, one of the best to ever play this game.\"</p>\n<p>Afterward, Ham was already focused on how he could continue to save James' best as the season progresses and Los Angeles builds toward its championship goal.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously, recovery process starts now,\" Ham said. \"But my hat's off to him, man. He never ceases to amaze us. He cares. He cares. That's why you see his type of stat line. He's laying it all out for his team in Year 21, and I just hope a lot of these young pros out here are looking and seeing what he's doing.\"</p>\n\n",
  "<p>DENVER -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> opened up his 21st season by being limited to 29 minutes in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401584689\" target=\"_blank\">119-107 loss</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> on Tuesday. Lakers coach Darvin Ham said the tapered workload for the 38-year-old superstar is part of the team's plan moving forward.</p>\n<p>\"It's easy with him to get caught up in the emotion of the game and you tend to forget you want to play these long stretches, but in order for him to be as effective as possible, we have to be mindful of the minute output and how long his stretches are,\" Ham said.</p>\n<p>The Nuggets led by as many as 18, jumping on L.A. in the opening quarter and riding the energy provided by a raucous Ball Arena crowd of 19,842 on hand to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38737724/denver-nuggets-receive-rings-see-title-banner-unveiled\" target=\"_blank\">celebrate the first ring night</a> in franchise history.</p>\n<p>By the time the crowd was chanting \"Who's your daddy?\" to mock the Lakers in the final minute, James was already done for the night, pulled with L.A. trailing 115-103.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>James still led L.A. in scoring with 21 points on 10-for-16 shooting and was tied for the team high with eight rebounds. He added five assists and committed zero turnovers, and his plus-minus of plus-7 was the best of any of the Lakers starters.</p>\n<p>\"Listen, I mean, I always want to be on the floor. Especially when you got an opportunity to win a game or you feel like you can make an impact,\" James said after the game. \"But this is the system in place and I'm going to follow it.\"</p>\n<p>When asked if he would have to adjust his approach with less playing time night to night, James made it clear that he was confident in his ability to impact the game with the added rest built in.</p>\n<p>\"Besides the fact that we didn't win,\" James said, \"I think for me, my performance and what I did individually in the time that I was out there, I think I was productive. I think so. I mean, I was a plus-7 for the game. No turnovers. I like the no turnovers more than anything.\"</p>\n<p>James played 35.5 minutes per game last season, the second most he played in five seasons with the Lakers, and ended up missing 27 games with a right foot injury.</p>\n<p>At L.A.'s media day earlier this month, Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka said the team \"partnered\" with James to come up with a plan to \"get him all the way to the end\" this season.</p>\n<p>Ham said that James' longtime athletic trainer, Mike Mancias, was consulted in the decision. James said he was \"not surprised or upset\" with how his minutes were managed against the Nuggets.</p>\n<p>While the team is opening the season with a plan to keep James in the 28-30 minute range, Ham said the number could fluctuate over time.</p>\n<p>\"It's going to be a day-by-day process, gauging how he's feeling, get communication from him, our training staff, our medical staff,\" Ham said.</p>\n<p>James' adjusted role will make it even more imperative for L.A. to get productive play out of the 30-year-old big man <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>.</p>\n<p>Davis led L.A. with 17 points on 6-for-11 shooting in the first half in Denver and went scoreless in the second half, going 0-for-6 from the field.</p>\n<p>\"They started double-teaming,\" Davis explained. \"They were trying to crowd the paint. I missed some easy layups around the rim and little jumpers. Just trying to make the right play, give it up to our guys. If I'm doubled, kick it out. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura\">Rui [Hachimura]</a> had an open 3, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe [Vincent]</a> had open 3s. They just didn't fall. But I got to shoot it more.\"</p>\n<p>Vincent, who finished with six points on 3-for-8 shooting in his Laker debut, acknowledged the need to involve Davis, but said L.A. also needs every player looking for his shot to optimize the offense overall.</p>\n<p>\"I think we're going to continue to try to get him involved,\" Vincent said. \"But it's important everyone stays aggressive. I think too many times we were caught standing still and watching. I think we all got to be aggressive and play the game. We're going to continue to find him and continue to find ways to be aggressive and so forth, so, we'll go from there.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p><b>LEBRON JAMES WAS</b> experiencing a big moment, and his veteran teammates wanted to make it memorable, it being his first NBA game and all.</p>\n<p>So they asked the 18-year-old rookie if he would take the honor of leading the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> onto the floor for the preseason opener at the Palace of Auburn Hills that early October night in 2003.</p>\n<p>James proudly ran out and got ready to start warmups before suddenly realizing he was by himself, a still sparse crowd looking at him awkwardly. Back in the tunnel, his teammates were roaring with laughter. Naïve and embarrassed, James could only shake his head at the joke. <alsosee></p>\n<p>Twenty years later to the week, there was no such hazing for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a> prized rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a> when he took an NBA court for the first time earlier this month in Oklahoma City.</p>\n\n\n<p>His teammates have spoken of Wembanyama in recent weeks not like a kid brother -- which is how the Cavs handled James to the point that then-coach Paul Silas occasionally had to step in to defend him like a father figure in the early days -- but with a certain amount of awe. Things have changed, it seems, for phenom teenage rookies.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I think he's just a freak of nature, it's not a normal thing to see,\" Spurs forward <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4610139/jeremy-sochan\">Jeremy Sochan</a> said. \"I'm here to help him.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"The days of treating [rookies] the same,\" veteran Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, \"left us long ago.\"</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><b>COMPARISONS BETWEEN JAMES</b> and Wembanyama are irresistible because of the hype surrounding the two No. 1 overall picks drafted two decades apart.</p>\n\n\n<p>James was a <a href=\"https://vault.si.com/vault/2002/02/18/ahead-of-his-class-ohio-high-school-junior-lebron-james-is-so-good-that-hes-already-being-mentioned-as-the-heir-to-air-jordan\">Sports Illustrated cover subject</a> in 2002 as a high school junior, then entered the NBA with a $90 million Nike contract and \"The Chosen One\" moniker just as Michael Jordan left. Wembanyama is a social media phenomenon whose jaw-dropping blend of skill and size might be unprecedented and who happily basks in his \"alien\" nickname, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34742371/lebron-james-praise-honor-goals-reach\">ironically given to him</a> by James. <video1></p>\n<p>They are viewed as being the same sort of can't-miss prospects by scouts, executives and media. Both were internationally famous before stepping into the league even without college basketball to magnify them.</p>\n<p>It's easy to forget James didn't arrive in the NBA fully formed in 2003. He had some since long-forgotten rough moments in his first weeks as a pro, which could be relevant to keep in mind as the Spurs rookie begins his much-hyped rookie season Wednesday night in his first regular-season game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a> (9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN).</p>\n<p>\"[Wembanyama] has had that hype for so long, kind of like LeBron did coming out. I compare him more to LeBron than [former Spurs No. 1 picks Tim Duncan and David Robinson] in that respect,\" Popovich said. \"And sure, I did worry about it. One of my major concerns was to figure out how to protect him or how I'm going to give him speeches about this and this and you got to look out for this and all that.\"</p>\n<p>James' first preseason was not one to savor. Though he had some highlight dunks and wowed fans by showing off his passing ability, he shot the ball poorly. He averaged just eight points over his first three preseason games and then had a rough two-game trip to Southern California on which he went 8-for-32 shooting in two games against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> and Clippers, with opposing players almost mocking him by standing back from him to dare him to shoot.</p>\n<p>One national journalist asked if \"hype\" was short for \"hey, you practice enough?\" after James' jumper looked so creaky.</p>\n<p>That's already a sharp contrast to Wembanyama, who has only amplified the interest in him with a dazzling preseason filled with highlight plays <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/player?id=38697909&enable=qaapi\">from nutmegs</a> to step-backs jumpers to eye-popping dunks. He put the finishing touches on it with a 19-point, five-block display Friday night in his first game in California against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I think I'm ready,\" Wembanyama told ESPN last week. \"I know I haven't seen the best level of the NBA so far and the best teams and the best players, but it's very exciting.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><b>WHETHER WEMBANYAMA'S PRESEASON</b> will translate to dominant regular-season games quickly is yet to be seen.</p>\n<p>James' first regular-season game, a road matchup in Sacramento, is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9895279/tenth-anniversary-lebron-smashing-debut\">remembered as historic</a>. His first quarter, in which he scored 12 points and got steals on three of four Kings possessions -- one leading to an iconic photo of his first official dunk (of 2,108 regular-season dunks and counting) -- was as surprising as it was statement-making. <photo2></p>\n<p>No one saw James' <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/231029023\">25-point, 9-assist, 4-steal game</a> coming because he'd shot 35% in seven preseason games and never cracked 20 points. Looking back 13 years later, James remained mildly surprised at how well he handled it.</p>\n<p>\"Just seeing how for an 18-year-old kid there really wasn't much I could tell him at that point,\" said James in 2016 talking about watching that first game years later. \"He was just excited to be on the court, and he was just having fun. This was before social media and all that, so he didn't really have to worry about anything, just go out and play and live with the results, live with whatever happened, and he's continued to do that.\"</p>\n<p>James' Cavaliers lost their opener by double figures and started that 2003-04 season 4-15. James was among the league leaders in turnovers over the first two months of the season, struggling as the team's starting point guard before he was truly ready for that assignment.</p>\n<p>Wembanyama is playing in an experimental lineup out of the gate. The Spurs plan to start the season with one natural guard, shooting guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395630/devin-vassell\">Devin Vassell</a>, and four forwards/centers with Sochan playing point and Wembanyama likely to get some ballhandling duties. And, as James noted, Wembanyama will have to compete under what will likely be a fair amount of social media scrutiny, perhaps similar to what he faced <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/37976554/2023-nba-summer-league-three-takeaways-victor-wembanyama-disappointing-debut\">during his disappointing debut</a> at the NBA 2K24 Summer League.</p>\n<p>The Spurs are a potentially exciting team with Wembanyama bringing them increasing levels of attention, appearing on national television 19 times this season compared to just once a season ago. However, like the Cavs in James' first year -- Cleveland finished 35-47 and missed the playoffs -- the Spurs might not be a good team.</p>\n<p>Still, Wembanyama's seemingly stress-free early days have fostered confidence. He was nervous before his preseason debut in Oklahoma City two weeks ago, struggling to sleep with extra energy, but he mostly has looked smooth since.</p>\n<p>Unlike James, who started his rookie season with a three-game West Coast road trip, Wembanyama also gets his first two games at home.</p>\n<p>Popovich has admitted he's dropped his guard a little from being extra protective the more he has watched Wembanyama manage both the spotlight and the transition to the NBA game. Though the preseason isn't what it used to be back when James was starting out -- back then it wasn't unusual for stars to play over 30 minutes and compete deep into fourth quarters in double the number of games -- Wembanyama has set a tone. <photo3></p>\n<p>\"This didn't just happen to him. For a pretty long time now, he's been lauded,\" Popovich said. \"He's learned to just let it go, in one ear, out the other. Water on a duck's back, all that sort of thing. He doesn't get impressed with any of the plots or criticism, he just wants to play and be the best player he can be.\"</p>\n<p>Memorabilia from James' first game has sold for more than two decades. Coming from different eras and quite different backgrounds and upbringings, his and Wembanyama's experiences are assured to be different no matter how the Spurs rookie's debut unfolds.</p>\n<p>But they also likely will have some things in common, too.</p>\n<p>\"It was my first time in the NBA and then to be able to be a part of an atmosphere like that,\" James remembered, \"it was pretty cool.\"</p>\n<p>Wembanyama was two months from being born when James had that experience. But even coming from a different generation, he wants the same thing.</p>\n<p>\"I'm looking forward to discovering all the stuff I used to see on TV. All the stories. All the arenas. The atmospheres. All of this is going to be really precious for me,\" Wembanyama said. \"I know it's going to lead to incredible things and obstacles. I know it's going to be a beautiful year. I know I'm forging forever memories right now.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Five months after getting swept out of the playoffs by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> and just days before opening up yet another season -- his 21st in the NBA -- against the very same opponent, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> generally took the high road when asked about the defending champions on Saturday.</p>\n<p>\"I don't get motivated against [who] the opponents [are] pretty much anymore,\" James said following one of the last training camp practices for the Lakers before the regular season tips off Tuesday in Denver. \"I don't need it. I don't want to say I don't get motivated to play, because I do get motivated to go against the competition, I love competing against the best. But I don't need an individual or a team to motivate me. I'm self-motivated. I'm enough.\"</p>\n<p>James' 20th season came to a close with a 40-point, 10-rebound, 9-assist performance in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals. James played all 48 minutes, but it still wasn't enough to stop L.A. from losing the game, 113-111, and the series, 4-0. The 38-year-old veteran told ESPN after the game that he would consider retirement in the offseason, with the season taking its toll on him both mentally and physically.</p>\n<p>The Nuggets went on to beat the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in the NBA Finals, earning the first championship in franchise history, and took a few shots at L.A. as part of their celebration tour. Denver coach Michael Malone was introduced as \"the Lakers' daddy\" during the team's parade. Malone, once an assistant coach of James' with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>, also poked fun at his former player's retirement sentiments.</p>\n<p><alsosee> </p>\n<p>\"Speaking of the Lakers, I just want you guys to know -- this is breaking news -- I'm thinking about retiring, so don't tell anybody,\" Malone said as a guest on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\"</p>\n<p>James appeared to address Malone on his Instagram in June, without acknowledging him by name. \"I hear I'm on your mind that much, huh??? I mean I guess I see why ... Enjoy your light but just know I'm the SUN.\"</p>\n<p>When asked on Saturday what makes him respond to the many detractors who have taken aim at him over the course of his decades-long career, and what makes him sometimes choose silence, James vowed to bark back at everyone someday in the distant future.</p>\n<p>\"There will be a time,\" James said. \"When that time is, I don't know. I don't know if it's now or ... there will be a time. There will be a time when everybody will get it, for sure.\"</p>\n<p>For now, he wants to get a chance to add a fifth title to his already impressive résumé.</p>\n<p>\"[I am] still seeing that Larry O'Brien Trophy in my mind on a daily basis,\" James said.</p>\n<p>Lakers coach Darvin Ham said this week that he believes there are eight teams that are \"legitimate contenders\" this season and \"I like our chances better than anybody's.\"</p>\n<p>James echoed his coach's confidence but wouldn't place L.A. amongst the rest of the field.</p>\n<p>\"We could be a really, really good team,\" James said. He added: \"I don't even look to June. It's too precious -- the game is too precious -- and I don't play with the basketball gods like that. I don't take it for granted.\"</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Ham finally named a fifth starter for the opener, revealing that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990962/taurean-prince\">Taurean Prince</a> will join James, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/dangelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a> with the first unit. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278077/jarred-vanderbilt\">Jarred Vanderbilt</a>, who filled that position last season, had his sore left heel reevaluated Friday and was a limited participant at practice. Vanderbilt is listed as day-to-day by the team, and Ham said \"in all likelihood\" he would be unavailable against Denver.</p>\n<p>While Vanderbilt continues to progress, L.A. will at least have its leader back at 100%, after James missed 27 games last season with a right foot injury.</p>\n<p>\"It took a few months, but then when I was able to get back into my workouts, I was able to do some things I wasn't capable of doing throughout the whole playoffs, probably even before the playoffs,\" James said of his offseason rehab. \"My workouts started getting better, my wind started getting better, my quick-twitch started getting better. I didn't have to think about it as much.</p>\n<p>\"It's great to have that feeling, just have your motor back.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

His teammates clapped in the background.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>Although James did not play with the team at the event, his appearance was another sign that he's progressing toward his goal of returning to the court.

Beating the odds to rise out of his hard-scrabble Akron, Ohio, upbringing. Beating defenders off the dribble on foray after foray to the hoop. Beating playoff opponent after playoff opponent en route to four rings and 10 trips to the NBA Finals.

So I took a second year off.</p>\n<p>\"For him to go [21] straight years is ridiculous.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Despite injuries taking their toll -- James has missed 27, 26 and 27 games over the past three years, respectively -- a glimpse back at last season shows how he flirted with glory once again.</p>\n<p>He supplanted Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the league's all-time leading scorer (38,387 points), a record that Abdul-Jabbar had held for James' entire lifetime. And after dealing with a right foot injury in which James said he \"pretty much tore the whole tendon,\" he returned to push the Lakers to the Western Conference finals, extending his streak of appearing in 282 playoff games without sitting.</p>\n<p>What's next for Year 21? Here are five things to consider as James embarks on his quest for a fifth championship:</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>1. How will the Lakers manage James' minutes?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Lakers coach Darvin Ham played James fewer minutes in 2022-23 than the previous season (35.5 per game compared to 37.2), but it was still the second-most playing time he's logged since joining the Lakers in 2018.</p>\n<p>L.A. has allowed James to ease into this training camp and the preseason, incorporating rest days as he ramps up for the real thing, starting Oct. 24 on the road against the defending champion <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<p>\"It's easy with him navigating these so-called 'challenges of the unknown' because he takes such good care of himself and is constantly preparing himself,\" Ham said before Wednesday's game.</p>\n<p>\"Again, not to just be available but be available at the highest [level]. We'll just take it day by day and see where it goes.\"</p>\n<p>L.A. has purposefully built its team with not just depth, but what it believes to be playmaking depth, so that even if James' minutes aren't cut significantly, more of his time spent on the court can be with players such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/dangelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura\">Rui Hachimura</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> and Wood, who can dictate the action, rather than defer to the veteran to expend the energy to constantly set the table.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>2. What is James chasing in the record books?</h2>\n\n\n<p>James is 1,348 points away from becoming the first NBA player to amass 40,000 points in the regular season. But if you tally up all his scoring -- including postseason points -- there's an international record he's closing in on, too.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Oscar Schmidt, a Brazilian basketball player whose career in multiple leagues overseas spanned from the mid-1970s through the early 2000s, scored 49,737 career points through all of his recorded games -- the most by any player, anywhere, in history. James enters the season at 48,080.</p>\n<p>For the guy who came into the league saying his goal was to one day be known as a \"global icon,\" passing Schmidt would be a full-circle moment.</p>\n<p>James can also move up to No. 1 in all-time NBA minutes played (regular season and playoffs) by logging 549 more to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.</p>\n<p>There are a few other major top-10 lists he can also climb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With 56 games played, he'll move from No. 9 to No. 6 on the career list, passing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/937/kevin-willis\">Kevin Willis</a>, Kevin Garnett and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/501/karl-malone\">Karl Malone</a>.</li>\n<li>James needs one triple-double to break a tie with Jason Kidd for No. 4 on that list.</li>\n<li>With 30 regular-season wins, he'll skirt by Malone and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/812/john-stockton\">John Stockton</a> for fourth place.</li>\n<li>If he makes 292 more free throws, he'll pass Kobe Bryant for No. 3 all time.</li>\n<li>And 22 more steals will put him at No. 8, moving ahead of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3686/clyde-drexler\">Clyde Drexler</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>3. How does James compare to others who've played this long in the league?</h2>\n\n\n<p>When James takes the court against the Nuggets, he'll become the sixth player in the league's 77-year history to make it to his 21st season or beyond, joining Garnett, Willis, Vince Carter, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3814/robert-parish\">Robert Parish</a> and Dirk Nowitzki.</p>\n<p>Those five players averaged a <em>combined</em> 29.0 points per game in their 21st seasons, led by Garnett's 7.6. James is coming off a season in which he averaged 28.9.</p>\n<p>He is set to obliterate the standards of production for a player at this stage of his career.</p>\n<p>There has been a single instance of a player scoring 25 points or more in a game in his 21st season or beyond, let alone coming close to averaging that sum. Nowitzki dropped 30 points in his final home game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a> in 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It's all about my health,\" James told ESPN when asked about continuing to extend his prime. \"And my mindset, if I'm able to keep my mind fresh. However your mind is, everything else falls into place. So, keeping my mind fresh, keeping it in tune, keeping it intact for the marathon will allow my body to perform after that.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>4. What does James think of L.A.'s roster?</h2>\n\n\n<p>James refrained from commenting on the Lakers' offseason moves until media day, other than sharing images on his Instagram stories of all the players L.A. signed.</p>\n<p>When he finally spoke about the roster, he offered a ringing endorsement.</p>\n<p>\"I'm excited about us returning our core,\" James said on media day, \"and then bringing in a lot of very, very, very good players that can help us continue to roll.\"</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>And remember how James blasted the team for its lack of \"lasers\" following the Lakers' season-opening loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> last October? Following the Lakers' preseason win against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn Nets</a> on Oct. 9, when L.A. connected on 20 of its 55 attempts from 3, he credited that aspect of the team construction as well.</p>\n<p>\"We have better shooting this year,\" James said after the win. \"We have a lot of guys who shot the ball extremely well from the 3-point line last year.\"</p>\n<p>A consistent 3-point arsenal would be a welcome addition to L.A.'s offense. The Lakers opened up last season with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34944387/lakers-failed-provide-lebron-james-3-point-shooters-once-again\">the worst 3-point shooting performance in the history of the sport</a> through the first four games and finished 25th in the league, shooting 34.6% from the outside. While the roster gained competent shooters after the trade deadline, L.A. only managed to connect on 33.5% of its 3s in the playoffs -- with James hitting an anemic 26.4% on 6.6 attempts a game.</p>\n<p>Adding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990962/taurean-prince\">Taurean Prince</a>, who shot 38.1% from 3 for Minnesota; Wood, who shot 37.6% for Dallas; Vincent, who shot 37.8% in Miami's postseason run to the Finals; and finding more opportunities for Russell, Hachimura and Reaves (coming off a summer when he shot 50% from deep at the FIBA World Cup) should improve that area.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>5. What will be different for James in Year 21?</h2>\n\n\n<p>The Lakers opened media day with Davis -- not James -- as the first player to speak to reporters, allowing the veteran big man's voice to set the tone.</p>\n<p>It was a subtle shift from James offering the initial locution, customary for his teams in the past but not an insignificant change in the itinerary.</p>\n<p>Not long after, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38551383/lebron-james-says-anthony-davis-face-lakers-franchise\">James told ESPN that Davis was \"the face\" of the Lakers franchise</a>, thrusting the torch in Davis' hands whether he was ready to receive it or not.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, James spent the summer training with Hachimura one-on-one, with the 25-year-old forward making several trips to meet James on the road and learn from a mentor ready to pass on more than two decades' worth of knowledge.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>James said the time he spent sidelined with a foot injury last season ended up getting him more excited about the game, adding that watching and analyzing his teammates let him become fans of their games.</p>\n<p>He might not show any outward signs of slowing down, but there has been a conceptual shift for James.</p>\n<p>Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka said the team \"partnered\" with James to come up with a plan to \"get him all the way to the end.\" In other words, to put him in position to hit June with as much left in the tank as possible.</p>\n<p>Long lauded for his unselfish approach when the ball is in his hands, James might find it OK to have the ball be in his teammates' hands more and more and pick his spots to flash the skill that will land him in the Hall of Fame before long.</p>\n<p>\"He understands how much his teammates mean and how much they support him,\" Ham told ESPN. \"And he also understands how to allow them to support him. ... Us putting together a well-balanced roster is going to help him excel that much more, hopefully in an efficient manner.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Fill in the blank: Giannis over Jokic for No. 1 ______.</h2>\n<p><b>Tim Bontemps:</b> Should be flipped. Antetokounmpo is a fantastic player, but Jokic led Denver to the championship last year, and in doing so answered all questions about his ability to drive winning at the highest level. I'm a firm believer in that ability to carry over to the next season, and is why Jokic should've been No. 1.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p><b>Bobby Marks:</b> Is predictable. During the regular season, Antetokounmpo is the most complete player in the NBA. He is a former two-time MVP and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 2020. My question is where would Antetokounmpo rank if the criteria was based solely on clutch time at the end of games? Would Antetokounmpo rank No. 1 versus the likes of Jokic, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic\">Luka Doncic</a> or James?</p>\n<p><b>Dave McMenamin:</b> Is breaking an unwritten rule. The NBA doesn't have many incontrovertible rules in its code of honor, but one of them is this: If you're already considered one of the best players in the league and your team climbs to the top of the mountain while you take home Finals MVP, you start the next season with the tacit title of the best player in the world. Jokic is currently that dude.</p>\n<p><b>Kevin Pelton:</b> Is inconsistent with NBArank history. Jokic earned the \"best player\" belt by performing at an MVP level over a deep playoff run after previously establishing himself as a superior regular-season player than Antetokounmpo over the past three years. In the past, players like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> in 2019 and Durant in 2021 have carried over that playoff ascendance to NBArank.</p>\n<p><b>Kendra Andrews:</b> Is in line with how Jokic is viewed. The Nuggets and Jokic have always struggled to get respect, and this is a continuation with that. Jokic won back-to-back MVPs, was named Finals MVP and led his team to an NBA championship. Antetokounmpo is incredible -- and when he got those three honors he was atop the league -- but right now, that title should go to Jokic.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>2. Fact or fiction: This is James' final year in the top 10.</h2>\n<p><b>McMenamin:</b> Fiction. As James has repeatedly said, so long as his mind stays sharp and dedicated to the sport, his body will follow and he'll do the work necessary to remain on top of the game. It's hard to imagine a ranker purposefully selecting a healthy James outside of their top 10.</p>\n<p><b>Marks:</b> Fiction. Call me naive, but it is hard for me to see James falling out of the top 10 as long as he is in the NBA. Yes, there are questions about his durability -- he has appeared in 45, 56 and 55 games the past three seasons -- and a three-spot drop indicates that James is not the elite player he once was. But unless <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards\">Anthony Edwards</a> (ranked No. 13) plays like an MVP candidate this season or James suffers a serious injury, it is hard to see him dropping out.</p>\n<p><b>Bontemps:</b> Fact. This is just a bet on Father Time. It's wild we are even discussing whether James will still be in the top 10 in the season he'll enter his 22nd NBA season at 39 years old.</p>\n<p><b>Pelton:</b> More fiction than fact. My suspicion is if we did these rankings as tiers, James would be in the same tier as several players ahead of him and nobody behind him. As a result, even another expected year of aging would likely leave James in the top 10 -- albeit perhaps not as close to the group of younger stars ahead of him.</p>\n<p><b>Andrews:</b> Fiction. I'm hard pressed to believe James won't even be considered a top 10 player as long as he's playing. Even if he's not necessarily playing his best, his ranking will almost always be based somewhat on his overall reputation; that he's one of the greatest players -- if not <i>the</i> greatest -- in league history.</p>\n<p><video2></p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>3. What's one thing you would change about our top 100?</h2>\n<p><b>Andrews:</b> I don't think rookies should be included. In a year that features a prospect as unprecedented as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a>, it might sound weird to leave out him and other highly touted draft picks, but until they compete against NBA talent in games that matter, how can we really judge where they'll stack up?</p>\n<p><b>Bontemps:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3078576/derrick-white\">Derrick White</a> should be on it. A terrific two-way guard who is among the best defensive guards in the league, White should be comfortably inside the top 100. There's a reason Boston has invested so much in White.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p><b>McMenamin:</b> You should have to win a playoff series to make it into the top eight. I'm not making this rule up just to discredit Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, he would just so happen to fall victim to it if it was implemented right now. The league is all about winning.</p>\n<p><b>Marks:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a> falling from No. 11 to 43. Harden is a walking distraction for any team he is on but is still one of the top 25 players in the NBA. The guard is coming off a regular season in which he led the league in assists (he also averaged a career-best assist-turnover ratio), shot the second-highest 3-point percentage in his career and averaged at least 20 points for an 11th consecutive season.</p>\n<p><b>Pelton:</b> Besides the omission of White and Giannis over Jokic, I'd flag <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler\">Jimmy Butler</a> being too low. He's performed like a top-three player in the playoffs since getting to the Heat, driving a pair of Finals appearances and a third trip to the conference finals, and his regular-season value is underrated, too. To me, Butler belongs in the same tier as KD and LeBron at this point.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>4. How many seasons until Wembanyama is a top-10 player on this list?</h2>\n<p><b>Andrews:</b> Three to five. It'll be a combination of the Spurs climbing out of the bottom of the conference and also other players that are sure to occupy the top 10 falling out of those places.</p>\n<p><b>Bontemps:</b> Four to five. It'll take Wembanyama some time to adjust to the NBA, and for the Spurs to put a team around him that maximizes his skillset. Once those things happen, he'll be a fixture at the highest levels of this list for a long time.</p>\n<p><b>Marks:</b> Five. Outside of James, the top 10 is dominated by players (Antetokounmpo, Jokic, Embiid, Doncic, for example) that are in the prime of their careers. You can even make a case that Anthony Edwards or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a>, two players that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38625043/nbarank-2023-player-rankings-2023-24-50-11&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1697067026197153&usg=AOvVaw09Uv7kAgPgswLEVQbZF6N_\">fall in the next 10</a>, will make a significant jump into the elite category before Wembanyama does.</p>\n<p><b>McMenamin:</b> Six or seven. This is less about Wemby and more about the guys he'd have to leapfrog that all are squarely in their primes and don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. Hey, maybe Jokic decides to hang it up sooner than expected to go be with his horses full time and a seat opens up for Wemby.</p>\n<p><b>Pelton:</b> Two to three years. I think the rest of the panel is being too conservative. It took two years for Doncic to go from ranked lower than Wembanyama as a rookie (No. 67) to fourth entering his third season. There's no guarantee Wembanyama will follow a similar path, but it tends to happen quickly for the NBA's truly elite talents.</p>\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>5. Which player outside the top 50 has the best chance to enter the top 25 next season?</h2>\n<p><b>Bontemps:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432166/cade-cunningham\">Cade Cunningham</a>. After missing out practically all of last season with injuries, Cunningham was terrific with Team USA's Select Team this summer and looks poised to have a terrific season for the improved Pistons.</p>\n<p><b>McMenamin:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson\">Zion Williamson</a>. Yes, he's missed 194 games over his first four seasons. But when he's been on the court, he's been wildly successful: 25.8 points on 60.5% shooting with 7.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game. And he's still just 23 years old.</p>\n<p><b>Andrews:</b> Williamson. Before Wemby-mania, the biggest hype surrounding an incoming player was Williamson, and it was for a good reason. His lack of availability has been the knock against him, but when he's on the court, he dominates. If he's able to actually play a nearly full 2023-24 season, there's no reason he won't skyrocket up this list.</p>\n<p><b>Pelton:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4566434/franz-wagner\">Franz Wagner</a>. After averaging 18.6 PPG at age 21, Wagner vaulted from off the list a year ago to No. 52 now. Another year of development for Wagner and more attention on the Magic if they can contend for a spot in the play-in tournament could put him on the cusp of an All-Star appearance.</p>\n<p><b>Marks:</b> The obvious answer is Zion, but I am going outside the box and select Wagner. I don't read much into the preseason, but the Orlando forward had an efficient nine points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field in only 15 minutes Tuesday against New Orleans. The short sample was enough for Pelicans forward <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2580365/larry-nance-jr\">Larry Nance Jr</a>. to comment that Wagner is a top three under-appreciated talent in the league. Wagner averaged 13.4 points in this summer's FIBA World Cup and help lead Germany to a gold medal, averaged a career-high 18.5 points last season and has missed only four games in two years.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Bonus! Give us your way-too-early picks for the top five for 2024-25.</h2>\n<p><b>Bontemps:</b> Jokic, Antetokounmpo, Embiid, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum\">Jayson Tatum</a>, Doncic. There isn't usually a ton of change at the very top of this list, and I don't anticipate much next year. But I think Jokic is likely to claim the top spot, and given I expect Boston to be in the Finals, I think Tatum will crack the top five for the first time.</p>\n<p><b>Marks:</b> With apologies to Embiid, I have the same top five outside of the current MVP. The final spot goes to Tatum. The forward earned back-to-back All-NBA first team and finished fourth in MVP voting last season. Now with the addition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3995/jrue-holiday\">Jrue Holiday</a>, do not be surprised if Tatum has a career year.</p>\n<p><b>McMenamin: </b>Tatum is the guy who gets in, although I have him taking Doncic's spot. The Celtics have a better shot of making a deep run than the Mavericks and, I can't stress it enough, winning has to matter in these rankings.</p>\n<p><b>Pelton:</b> Jokic, Antetokounmpo, Tatum, Embiid and Doncic. The Celtics are my preseason title pick, and if that comes true I think Tatum will easily elevate into not only the top five but perhaps the top three.</p>\n<p><b>Andrews:</b> Tatum, Jokic, Antetokounmpo, Embiid and Curry are my top five for next season. I still can't quite get myself to buy into the Mavs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

  "<p>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Two decades into his NBA career, with a trophy shelf that's running out of room due to all of his accomplishments, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> sounds ready to pass the torch to teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> as the leader of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>.</p>\n<p>\"He is the face [of the franchise],\" James told ESPN during the Lakers' annual media day Monday. \"You look at all these [retired] numbers that surround this facility, all the greats that have come here and AD is one of them.\"</p>\n<p>Heading into the offseason, James' and Davis' contracts ran concurrently with one another -- with both players having an option on the final years of deals to stay in L.A. through the 2024-25 season.</p>\n<p>Davis pushed his timeline past James' in August, however, by signing a three-year, $186 million max extension that will keep him with the purple and gold through 2028.

The same level of success did not follow, with L.A. losing in the first round in 2021 and failing to qualify for the 2022 postseason altogether as injuries to Davis and others took their toll.</p>\n<p>But Davis and the Lakers enjoyed a resurgent run to the Western Conference finals in the spring, with the eight-time All-Star putting up career bests in field goal percentage (56.3) and rebounds (12.5) while posting 25.9 points and 2.0 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>However, when asked directly by a reporter if his new contract makes him feel like it is now his team, Davis did not indulge in the line of questioning.</p>\n<p>\"I think this is the Lakers' team, and I play for the Lakers,\" Davis said flatly.</p>\n<p>There is no downplaying Davis' importance to the team -- whether it comes with the unofficial title as face of the franchise or not -- and he acknowledged as much.</p>\n<p>\"I think I'm going to be the second-oldest guy here now so guys lean on me a lot,\" said the 30-year-old Davis. \"I feel like it's my responsibility, being one of the leaders of the team alongside Bron. It's my job to help those guys and help the young guys and continuously being on them. Let them know what we need and what we need to get better and giving them advice so we can all be together and unified to be able to compete for a championship.\"</p>\n<p>Davis, who missed 26 games last season because of a foot injury, said his \"body feels good\" heading into training camp and he maintains the same goal he had going into last season of staying on the court as much as possible.</p>\n<p>\"It's my goal every year to play 82 [games],\" Davis said. \"And I didn't do anything different [this summer]. I took some time off. Got back in the lab and I'm ready to get started. Nothing's changed. Every year you want to come out every game and give your team an opportunity to win. Especially with my role, I know it's a big piece of this team and with me being on the floor, it definitely helps us.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Statistically, James was still impactful -- averaging 28.9 points on 50% shooting with 8.3 rebounds and 6.8 assists -- but a torn tendon in his right foot caused him to miss 27 games.</p>\n<p>While there's been little noticeable drop off in James' overall game since he signed with the Lakers, his body has betrayed him at times. He's missed 111 games because of injury in the last five seasons after only missing 71 games in his first 15 years in the league.</p>\n<p>Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka praised James' offseason work ethic and mental approach following the Lakers' disappointing end to the postseason when they were swept out of the Western Conference finals by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>.</p>\n<p>\"It's staggering for a player who has 20 years under the hood already and is preparing for 21 like he's a rookie,\" Pelinka said. \"He's been doing 6 a.m. workouts.

Lillard got his wish, the signature player in Wednesday's stunning three-team deal that sent him from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> to the Bucks.</p>\n<p>Harden, however, remains with the 76ers, and he is not too happy about it.</p>\n<p><offer></offer></p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>In fact, Harden, 34, seems likely to miss the start of the season and perhaps a considerable amount of it while he awaits his own trade. After all, Harden has a history in this respect, forcing his way out of Houston and Brooklyn in recent seasons. He expects to be traded, but his situation is different than what Lillard dealt with in Portland, with far less acrimony. The non-contending Blazers wanted to help Lillard. The contending 76ers may not feel the same way.</p>\n<p>While Lillard starred last season, Harden is not nearly the same player he used to be when he was winning league scoring titles and carrying fantasy teams. He still averaged 21 PPG and 10.7 APG in his age-33 campaign last season, along with 6.1 RPG and 2.8 3PG, but his usage was down, and he struggled to finish at the hoop, and in earning trips to the foul line.</p>\n<p>Lillard, playing in 58 games, finished No. 6 on ESPN's Player Rater, 17th in points formats. Harden, also over 58 games, finished No. 26 on the Rater, and 28th in points formats.</p>\n<p>Harden is angry. He is bitter. We should believe him when he says he will not play for Philadelphia again. This feels like the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907387/ben-simmons\">Ben Simmons</a> saga, years later, and fantasy managers should want no part of it. Fantasy drafts are about value and there is a clear risk/reward aspect in the early rounds. The Do Not draft list focuses on value.</p>\n<p>Harden in the second round is way too much risk based on the current situation. The 76ers are under no obligation to placate him with a trade.

James played in 55 games. The year prior, he played in 56 games. James turns 39 in late-December, so it is quite understandable that, after 20 NBA seasons and more than 1,700 games between the regular season and playoffs, the league's all-time leading scorer would miss more games than most. How many games is enough for you in fantasy? James was not Lillard or Harden, though. He was the No. 50 option on the Player Rater, though 31st in points formats. Regardless, he should not be going ninth overall in ESPN ADP.

Williamson has played in 114 games of the team's 308 contests in four seasons. While we hope this trend ends this season, there is little evidence it will, and Williamson is also not like James statistically. Williamson seems capable of higher scoring output, but he is not much of a 3-point option, and not a great free throw shooter. His 7 RPG are hardly special.

Again, there is little evidence that changes this season, even with the league paying more attention to stars and load management. Leonard has also seen his scoring output fall in consecutive seasons, and he averaged only 3.9 APG and 1.4 SPG last season, below expected results. Name value should not be a factor in drafts. Leonard is going in Round 4. Plenty of durable players offer similar production later on.

  "<p><video1></p>\n<p>Every year at this time, I project the box score stats for every rotation player in the NBA in preparation for the upcoming season. I then use those projections as the basis for my preseason fantasy basketball player rankings.</p>\n<p>The positive of this quantitative approach is that it separates my analysis from traditional name-value recognition, and instead looks more towards team situation and expected values in making my initial rankings.</p>\n<p>When taking this approach, however, there are often results that might not fit with preconceived expectations. That's why we're here today.</p>\n<p>In this space, I'm going to list some of the biggest names in the NBA and fantasy basketball -- players that we're used to seeing on SportsCenter and drafting in the first round of our fantasy leagues -- who are ranked much lower this season . But, for various reasons, I project their overall numbers to be a bit lower than their norm this season. Let's dig into it.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a></h3>\n<p>Durant got traded to the Suns last season and formed a potent 1-2 with star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a>. Interestingly, it was Booker that was the primary scoring and playmaking option while Durant settled in as an elite option 1B.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Then, this offseason the Suns traded for another high-volume perimeter scorer in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal\">Bradley Beal</a> to form a big three that further nibbles into Durant's expected numbers. Even so, I still project Durant to be one of the best sources of fantasy production in the NBA on a per-game basis. He ranks 10th in my per game rankings, which would still mark him as a first round talent in fantasy basketball leagues on a per game basis.</p>\n<p>But fantasy hoops isn't about just one game, it's about the entire season. And the old cliché holds true; when it comes to fantasy points, the best ability is availability.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Durant has not been available as much as I'm sure he would have liked to be in recent years. In the last four seasons, Durant has played a total of 137 games. That would translate to an average of only 34.3 games played per season. Even if you exclude the 2019-20 season that he missed while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon, he has still only averaged 45.7 games played in the last three seasons with a high of 55 games.</p>\n<p>Durant will be 35 years old when this NBA season begins, entering year 17 in the league, and even though his game doesn't rely on the type of explosive leaping or cutting ability that falls off over time, the increased risk of injury with age has become a significant factor when it comes to drafting Durant to your fantasy hoops squad.</p>\n<p>I initially projected Durant for 62 games played this season, which would be his highest game total since the 2018-19 season. But, with 62 games played, Durant would end up 31st in my player rankings. I upped his projection to 66 games, but he still settles in at 23rd in my rankings.</p>\n<p>Practically speaking, Durant is still extremely likely to go in the first couple rounds of your fantasy leagues, perhaps even in the first round of some leagues. So, the takeaway here is that anyone drafting him that early is doing so at their own risk.</p>\n<p>Yes, KD is still probably the purest scorer in the NBA. On a Suns team with a lot of firepower, his scoring efficiency should be through the roof and he should have plenty of energy to play defense and crash the boards. When he's on the court, he likely remains one of the top-10 sources of fantasy hoops production in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Father Time is undefeated and Durant has a multi-year track record of being at higher risk for injury. I hope that Durant plays 70-something games this season and accomplishes all his goals on the court. But, as you are preparing for your fantasy hoops drafts, just keep in mind...  the last time Durant played that many games in a season was three teams ago, when he was playing with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a> and the Warriors.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136195/karl-anthony-towns\">Karl-Anthony Towns</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a></h3>\n<p>Towns has battled for the top spot in my fantasy hoops player rankings several times in recent years, and at only 27 years old he should be right at the peak of his prime NBA years. Towns has battled injury in recent years, playing 50 or fewer games in three of the last four seasons including a career-low 29 games last season, and this obviously affects his ranking. This isn't necessarily the biggest factor in Towns' slide in this season's rankings, however.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Instead, Towns' estimated production is diminished on a per-game basis because of two of his teammates. The Timberwolves traded for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert\">Rudy Gobert</a> last season, moving Towns from center to power forward and further away from the rim. Where this impacted Towns' numbers most is on defense, where he turned in career-lows in rebounds, blocked shots and even steals per game.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the court, Towns is taking a backseat to the rise of 22-year-old <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards\">Anthony Edwards</a> into an NBA superstar. Last season, Towns took his fewest field goal attempts per game and scored his fewest points since his rookie year. This season, Edwards likely takes another step forward and further relegates Towns to a second option.</p>\n<p>With Edwards and Gobert squeezing his production at both ends of the court, Towns just isn't one of the elite fantasy producers in the NBA going into this season.</p>\n<h3>Other stars who slid in the rankings</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard\">Damian Lillard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a>:</strong> Both in standoffs with their current teams about what team they will play for this season. Lillard has requested a trade from the Trail Blazers, specifically to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a>, while Harden has said he would never play again on a team associated with Daryl Morey... and the 76ers have shown no inclination to fire Morey.</p>\n<p>Both Harden and Lillard have lived at the top of fantasy rankings for years, but the uncertainty as to their immediate futures makes it difficult to project them anywhere near their typical values.</p>\n<p>In Lillard's case, the Trail Blazers have seemingly moved full-bore into a youth movement/rebuild that Lillard has expressed no interest in being part of at this point in his career. They also are poised to hand over the keys to the franchise to talented rookie point guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683678/scoot-henderson\">Scoot Henderson</a>, whose game wouldn't really fit next to Lillard's.</p>\n<p>If Lillard were traded to the Heat, he would likely have to cede some of the shots he's used to taking to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler\">Jimmy Butler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066261/bam-adebayo\">Bam Adebayo</a>, but at least if that trade were made we could project his likely output with more confidence. What if, instead, he gets traded to a different contending team?</p>\n<p>Harden just led the NBA in assists last season, but he was a much lower volume shooter playing off MVP <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid</a>. He has the same type of questions regarding which team he might play for, and therefore what role he might be asked to play.</p>\n<p>For both players, the uncertainty led to lower projections at this time, and they are both therefore lower in the rankings this season than they normally would be.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson\">Zion Williamson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving\">Kyrie Irving</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george\">Paul George</a>: </strong>All five have a well-established history of missing games, primarily for injury, that slides them further down my season-long rankings.</p>\n<p>LeBron, AD and Zion are all in the top-10 of my per game rankings; Kyrie and Kawhi are top-20, and PG13 is top-40 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

While it's a possibility he might still <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38420249/sources-possibility-aaron-rodgers-returns-year\">return this season</a>, this wasn't what the Jets had in mind when they traded for him in the offseason.</p>\n\n\n<p>Miraculously, the team pulled out a win in Week 1, but a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547415\">30-10 drubbing</a> at the hands of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a> in Week 2 reminded everyone just how much they'll miss a healthy Rodgers this season.</p>\n\n\n<p>It is, of course, not the first time a player's heralded debut with a new team fell flat. The best-laid plans of mice and general managers often go awry, and many fans have been left scratching their heads after a ballyhooed acquisition dropped the ball in Game 1. With Rodgers on the mend, here are some others that came to mind.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a></h2>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>James' second stint with his hometown team in 2014-15 started inauspiciously. Playing against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> in Cleveland, James managed a paltry 17 points on 5-of-15 shooting (making only one of his five three-pointers) to go along with five rebounds, four assists and eight turnovers. LeBron would quickly turn things around, however, leading the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals that season and winning them the next.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Troy Aikman, Dallas Cowboys</h2>\n<p>Considering how Aikman ended up as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, it's surprising to recall that his rookie season was a bit of a disaster. Aikman started off 1989 going 17-for-35 with 180 yards passing and two interceptions in a shutout loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints\">New Orleans Saints</a>. It didn't get much better from there. He finished the season with nine touchdowns to 18 interceptions and an 0-11 W-L record. The Cowboys didn't lose faith, however, and Aikman won his first of three Super Bowls just three seasons later.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064514/julius-randle\">Julius Randle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a></h2>\n<p>The seventh pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Randle looked to be a good candidate to learn from Kobe Bryant at the back end of his legendary career. Randle's 2014-15 season lasted all of 14 minutes, however, as he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/11783195/julius-randle-los-angeles-lakers-suffers-serious-right-leg-injury-opener\">broke his tibia</a> in his debut and missed the rest of the season. After a few years with the Lakers and a single season with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a>, Randle has found a home as one of the pillars of the modern New York Knicks.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3989/blake-griffin\">Blake Griffin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a></h2>\n<p>Griffin had the bad fortune to get injured immediately <i>before</i> his debut. After landing on a dunk in his final preseason game in 2009, Griffin <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4597949\">broke his kneecap</a>, sidelining him for the entirety of what would have been his rookie season. Things went much better in 2010-11, with a fully recovered Griffin making the All-Star team and winning Rookie of the Year.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/45843/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/202/argentina\">Argentina</a></h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>Already a legend in the making, having led Argentina's youth team to a title and winning the tournament's Golden Ball in the process, Messi's first friendly with the senior team could have gone better. He was given a red card less than a minute after coming on later in the second half for elbowing Hungarian defender Vilmos Vanczak and reportedly was crying in the locker room afterward. Considering his incredible accomplishments since then, it's an almost unimaginable scene.</p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a></h2>\n<p>The first pick of the 2009 NFL draft, Stafford carried the hopes of Lions fans in his talented hands. Those hopes were (at least briefly) dashed in his first game, a 45-27 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Stafford went 16-for-36 for 205 yards passing with no touchdowns and three interceptions. Injuries would limit him for the remainder of the 2009 season and most of 2010, but he was fully operational in 2011, throwing for 5,038 yards and 41 touchdowns against 16 interceptions.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Chris Bosh, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a></h2>\n<p>The often-underappreciated but crucial third member of the Miami Heat's Big Three alongside James and Dwyane Wade, Bosh was ice cold in his 2010 debut with the team. He shot 3-for-11 from the field, pulled down eight rebounds and was minus-17 in an 88-80 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics\">Boston Celtics</a>. Fortunately for all involved, the Heat would end up pretty happy with Bosh and the Big Three, as they ended up winning back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n",

He played for the U.S. in the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the latter the summer before emerging as an MVP and NBA champion. At 6-foot-2, Curry is on the small side for a switch-heavy defense and not exactly the pass-first distributor the best USA teams have featured at point guard. Yet, the threat of his shooting from the shorter FIBA 3-point line makes Curry a no-brainer choice.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/phx.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Shooting guard: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a></strong></p>\n<p>Fresh off a loss in the NBA Finals in 2021, Booker averaged 20.7 minutes per game during the Tokyo Olympics, ranking fourth on the squad.

Having won two gold medals (2008, 2012) and a bronze (2004), James' commitment to the national team can't be questioned. He projects as the primary ball handler on this team after averaging 5.6 APG en route to gold in 2012.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/phx.png&h=110&w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Power forward: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a></strong></p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Winning a record fourth gold medal -- the most of any men's basketball player -- to go along with MVP of the 2010 FIBA World Championship (since renamed the World Cup) would cement Durant as the greatest player in USA Basketball history.

Embiid became a citizen of both the United States and host France last year, leaving the door open for him to join either team as a naturalized player instead of representing his native Cameroon, which will attempt to reach the 2024 Olympics by winning one of four qualifying tournaments next summer.</p>\n<p>Although Embiid's presence would require the USA to change styles, having not regularly featured a post-up center since DeMarcus Cousins in the 2014 World Cup, adding the reigning MVP would be well worth it.

The Lakers didn't make the same mistake of ill-fitting wholesale changes, as they did going into 2020-21. They didn't prioritize name recognition and experience over youth and athleticism, as they did going into 2021-22. They aren't still trying to make a three-star system work, as they did going into 2022-23.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>They maintained continuity while adding players who theoretically mesh with the defensive-minded expectations that Darvin Ham put in place in his first year as coach.

And they addressed the one glaring weakness of last season's team by adding shooting everywhere they could find it: Vincent shot 43% on catch-and-shoot 3s during the Heat's run through the playoffs, Prince hit 38.1% from deep last season, and rookie two-way signing D'Moi Hodge shot 40% from 3 for Missouri last season.</p>\n<p>Because of the timing of Wood's two-year, $5.7 million agreement -- the deal includes a player option in Year 2 -- coming nearly two months after the team's previous transactions when it signed draftees <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5105797/jalen-hood-schifino\">Jalen Hood-Schifino</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4684286/maxwell-lewis\">Maxwell Lewis</a>, it might stand out more than the others.</p>\n<p>The truth is, the most consequential moves the Lakers made were reupping their own stars.</p>\n<p>In addition to extending Davis, they re-signed the young trio of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37945661/sources-lakers-austin-reaves-agree-4-year-max-extension\">four years, $56 million</a>), <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/dangelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a> (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37945113/dangelo-russell-returning-lakers-2-year-37m-deal\">two years, $37 million</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura\">Rui Hachimura</a> (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37941303/source-lakers-retain-rui-hachimura-add-gabe-vincent\">three years, $51 million</a>). That core helped L.A. go 18-6 through the end of the regular season, play-in tournament and first two rounds of the playoffs. Add a healthy and rejuvenated <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> for his 21st season, and there are plenty of reasons for optimism in Lakerland.</p>\n<p>Wood could become a steal coming off a season in which he averaged 16.6 points and 7.3 rebounds while shooting 37.6% from 3 with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a>. He could use the Lakers' platform the same way <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066262/malik-monk\">Malik Monk</a> and Schroder did in recent seasons to reestablish value and gain an even bigger role if James or Davis miss any significant time because of injuries.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>But if Wood, who, according to NBA Advanced Stats, finished last <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense?TeamID=1610612742&dir=D&sort=DEF_RATING\">in individual defensive rating</a> among Mavericks rotation players last season, doesn't fit within the Lakers' agenda of coming together to pursue the franchise's 18th championship, there's little at stake.</p>\n<p>\"If he's on his best behavior, it could be a good fit,\" a league front office source told ESPN. \"If he's not, well, you cut him.\"</p>\n<p>Wood joins a franchise that's been on a roller coaster since winning the 2020 Finals inside the NBA's Orlando bubble. Despite that title, a mix of injuries and underwhelming trades has prevented the LeBron era from being considered a smashing success.</p>\n<p>Now, like any team with title aspirations, the Lakers hope their reinforced roster -- capped by their latest big man signing -- can stay healthy.

Let's dive in.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<h2>1. The Nuggets are heavy favorites to repeat <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/insider/story/_/id/38242869/win-loss-records-denver-nuggets-los-angeles-lakers-every-western-conference-team\">(according to us)</a>. Which team is in the best position to knock them out in a best-of-seven?</h2>\n<p><strong>Jamal Collier:</strong> I'm going with the Suns, who had a strong offseason to give <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a> some help after they were not able to carry the team past the Nuggets by themselves last playoffs. The acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal\">Bradley Beal</a> and some smart additions to fill out the roster this offseason -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136779/keita-bates-diop\">Keita Bates-Diop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3133838/yuta-watanabe\">Yuta Watanabe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278402/jordan-goodwin\">Jordan Goodwin</a> -- gives Phoenix a reputable bench to surround their stars. Beal should thrive in his new role, and being a third option will make a lot of people remember how talented of a scorer he is. Phoenix looks like Denver's best challenger in the West.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim MacMahon: </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a> had the NBA's best record last season before flopping in the first round, and the core of a recent championship team remains intact. It's reasonable for Antetokounmpo to question whether Milwaukee can remain a contender for the foreseeable future with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez\">Brook Lopez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3995/jrue-holiday\">Jrue Holiday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6609/khris-middleton\">Khris Middleton</a> all aging, however. The Bucks' window might not be open much longer, but it certainly is this season.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Pelton:</strong> The Celtics. The strongest case for Boston's offseason trade, swapping defensive stalwart <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990992/marcus-smart\">Marcus Smart</a> for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis\">Kristaps Porzingis</a>, was the equation Denver highlighted in the playoffs: Success is about how much shooting you can put on the court without sacrificing size. The Celtics can now match the Nuggets on both fronts, and Denver would be challenged to match up with Boston wings <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3917376/jaylen-brown\">Jaylen Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum\">Jayson Tatum</a> after losing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065670/bruce-brown\">Bruce Brown</a> in free agency.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Bontemps: </strong>I'll say the Warriors, because as dominant as Denver was in last year's playoffs, there is one type of opponent they didn't face: one with a devastating pick-and-roll guard to take advantage of Jokic. And there isn't a more devastating option in that respect than <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a>. None of that is meant to knock Denver's title run, which was very impressive. But it will be fun to see a Denver-Golden State matchup if one comes to fruition.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Lopez: </strong>The Bucks -- but only if they can manage to stay healthy. A healthy Milwaukee squad would prove formidable to the defending champs, but there are plenty of questions. Antetokounmpo missed 19 games last season, Holiday missed 15 and Middleton missed 49. As long as Antetokounmpo continues to play at his current level, the Bucks will always remain in the conversation to be among the league's top teams, but the overall health will determine if Milwaukee can once again become NBA champions.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n<h2>2. Forget about the Finals. Which team just needs to make the playoffs or show some marked improvement?</h2>\n<p><strong>Tim Bontemps: </strong>After the disaster that was last season, this has to be the Mavericks. The franchise is on the clock to convince <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic\">Luka Doncic</a> this team can contend for championships over the long-term. If this team misses the playoffs again -- or somehow misses the play-in tournament again -- the pressure in Dallas is going to intensify next summer, when Doncic only has two years left on his contract before he can be an unrestricted free agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamal Collier:</strong> The Timberwolves. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136195/karl-anthony-towns\">Karl-Anthony Towns</a> got injured so early in the season that the Wolves didn't get much of a chance to see their two bigs in action, but the early returns were not encouraging. Getting off to a strong start would help quell any early trade speculation for Towns and inspire faith in a trade that would be hard to argue Minnesota should make again if they had a do-over. The Wolves recovered to make the playoffs last year, but being a play-in team again could lead to another shakeup in Minnesota.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Lopez: </strong>In the four years since <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson\">Zion Williamson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3913176/brandon-ingram\">Brandon Ingram</a> joined the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a>, the team has made just one playoff series (a 4-2 loss to the Suns in the 2022 first round) and lost in the play-in tournament's 9-10 game the following season. Williamson's health aside, the Pelicans have struggled to break through in recent years. Since trading for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2490149/cj-mccollum\">CJ McCollum</a> at the deadline in Feb. 2022, McCollum, Williamson and Ingram have played in just 10 games together for a total of 172 minutes. The Pelicans need those numbers to go up to find more success.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Pelton: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a>. This is year three of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3978/demar-derozan\">DeMar DeRozan</a> era and also the final year of his contract. With an aging core of DeRozan, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine\">Zach LaVine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6478/nikola-vucevic\">Nikola Vucevic</a>, the Bulls are on the clock to show some kind of returns from giving up three first-round picks to add DeRozan and Vucevic after getting quickly eliminated in the 2022 first round and missing the playoffs entirely last spring.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim MacMahon: </strong>The Mavericks can't afford a repeat of last season's catastrophe. I don't think Doncic will look for reasons to leave Dallas, but logic would be smacking him in the face if the Mavericks miss the playoffs in the first two seasons of his supermax deal. The front office has felt that pressure, which is why the team has given up their 2029 first-round pick and unprotected 2030 swap rights over the last year to make significant upgrades to Doncic's supporting cast.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n<h2>3. Whether it's winning a title or bouncing back from an off-year, predict which superstar faces the most pivotal season?</h2>\n<p><strong>Jamal Collier:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant\">Ja Morant</a>. A year ago, Morant and the Grizzlies were one of the hottest young teams with one of the brightest futures in the league. Morant looked like a future MVP. Now after a 25-game suspension, I'll be curious to see what Morant can make of his season. Will the Grizzlies be able to salvage anything this year and look like a team still trending upward? The situation in Memphis is in a perilous state.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Lopez: </strong>I'll stick with the Pelicans on this one and focus on Williamson. Williamson played in just 29 games a season ago after a hamstring injury ended his season on Jan. 2. There was hope Williamson could come back around the All-Star break, but he never made his return. Williamson has been around the Pelicans' facility more this season as he begins the first year of his five-year, $194 million extension. He has taken steps to improve his body heading into the year but will that translate into playing more than 60 games in a season for only the second time? That remains to be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Bontemps: </strong>After his recent comments to the New York Times about his future, this upcoming season is massive for Antetokounmpo and the Bucks. Like with Doncic in Dallas, the Bucks are clearly on the clock with Antetokounmpo, who said he isn't going to extend and will have one year left before he can be a free agent next summer. If he and the Bucks don't win a title this season -- or at least reach the Finals -- all eyes will be on what he and the organization will do.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Pelton: </strong>We never got a real look at Minnesota's frontcourt of Towns and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert\">Rudy Gobert</a> last season because Towns' calf injury limited him to 29 games. It's possible the Timberwolves develop the necessary chemistry and make a deeper playoff run since 2004 -- the only time in franchise history they've won a playoff series. It's also possible things go poorly and Towns emerges as the most tradeable player as Minnesota retools around budding star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards\">Anthony Edwards</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim MacMahon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid</a> turns 30 this season, has never made it out of the second round of the playoffs and has dealt with a series of sagas involving the 76ers front office and his co-stars. Would anyone blame Embiid if he asked out after this season? It's up to Daryl Morey to figure out a way to wiggle out of the Harden mess with a roster that's good enough to convince Embiid that he doesn't have to leave Philadelphia for a real chance at a ring.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>4. Harden and Lillard could be traded to new teams. Which other star players could make a move before the season's end?</h2>\n<p><strong>Andrew Lopez: </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908809/donovan-mitchell\">Donovan Mitchell</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> rumors still haven't gone away despite the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> trading for Mitchell instead of the Knicks last season. Mitchell is extension eligible this offseason, and if Cleveland thinks there's even a chance that Mitchell may bolt, perhaps they look into seeing what value they can get for the player they just dealt three players -- including <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066336/lauri-markkanen\">Lauri Markkanen</a> -- three first-round picks and two pick swaps for.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamal Collier: </strong>It seems that the writing is on the wall for Towns. Edwards looks ready for a breakout season and the fit of Towns and Gobert still has so many question marks. If Minnesota gets off to anything less than a stellar start, the speculation is going to begin ramping up about their next move to shakeup the roster, and Towns could be the odd man out.</p>\n<p><inline1><strong>Tim Bontemps: </strong>I'll be curious to see what happens with DeRozan in Chicago. He's only got one year left until he's an unrestricted free agent, and the Bulls are unlikely to be a contender for anything more than a first round exit this season. Perhaps that will lead to DeRozan changing teams between now and February's trade deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Pelton: </strong>I don't know if Paul still fits into this category, but I'd peg him as the most likely to be dealt midseason after a pair of trades this summer landed him with the Warriors. Although Paul fills a need for the team by anchoring their offense with Curry on the bench, perhaps his greater value is financial flexibility. Golden State could trade Paul for a younger player on a longer contract if that's worth paying additional luxury tax in future years.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim MacMahon: </strong>It makes sense for Minnesota, with Edwards establishing himself as the face of the franchise, to explore Towns' value in the trade market. Minnesota made major investments in big men the last two summers with the Gobert trade and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396971/naz-reid\">Naz Reid</a> contract. It's an awkward fit at best with all three on the roster. The Wolves gave up a ton of draft capital in the Gobert deal, which clearly didn't vault the franchise to contender status. It did make Minnesota much more expensive, and Towns' supermax deal kicks in next season.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo5></p>\n<h2>5. Which notable signing, extension, or trade will be deemed a success by the time Christmas Day games roll around?</h2>\n<p><strong>Tim Bontemps:</strong> Not that there was much of a doubt about the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> contract when it was signed, but with the way he's played with Team USA this summer, it's quickly proven to be not just the best value of the deals signed this offseason, but the single-best non-max contract in the entire league -- especially as the cap starts to skyrocket. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> are incredibly fortunate no one tried to pry him away, and therefore were able to get him for the next three years.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamal Collier: </strong>I'll go with Beal again here. Phoenix might have him slightly miscast as a lead ball handler, but his addition is going to remind fans just how good he is as a scorer. Durant, Booker and Beal will be an elite offensive trio, and as long as they stay healthy and get to play together, I think all three will generate a ton of production. Even if Durant has to miss some time again, having Beal ready to take on a larger role will pay huge dividends. If Phoenix looks like a legit contender come Christmas time, it will because the Beal addition has paid off.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Lopez: </strong>My instinct here was to go with Porzingis moving to Boston. But if his plantar fasciitis bothers him in the early part of the season, that could slow how quickly he gets integrated into the flow of the team. Also, I definitely think both <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065778/max-strus\">Max Strus</a> (Cavaliers) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> (Lakers) will prove the big deals that took them away from Miami worth it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim MacMahon:</strong> Reaves' deal was a massive success by the time the ink dried and instantly became one of the best contracts in the NBA. He's proven himself as a high-caliber starter and secondary playmaker in the playoffs and is just entering his prime. He's a $100 million player who is being paid a little more than half of that because the Lakers benefited from some fine print in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Pelton: </strong>Since most of the biggest signings won't be judged until the postseason, let's go with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet\">Fred VanVleet</a> signing with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a>. If VanVleet's leadership and skill can get more out of the Rockets' recent first-round picks (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4437244/jalen-green\">Jalen Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4871144/alperen-sengun\">Alperen Sengun</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432639/jabari-smith-jr\">Jabari Smith Jr</a>.) than they were able to accomplish playing without a veteran point guard, his short-term max deal will easily be worth it within the first few months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><video></p>\n<p>As the NBA enters its 77th season and fans anticipate another exciting campaign, there's always an additional buzz surrounding the significant milestones and anniversaries that are set to unfold in 2023-24.</p>\n<p>One potential accomplishment to keep an eye is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a> -- the 10-time All-Star is 220 3-pointers away from passing Ray Allen for second on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers list. Whether that he completes the feat with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\" target=\"_blank\">Philadelphia 76ers</a> remains to be seen with Harden <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38696849/james-harden-skips-76ers-practice-second-day-row\" target=\"_blank\">asking for a trade</a>. </p>\n<p>From individual players etching their names into the record books, such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook\">Russell Westbrook</a>, to remembering iconic matchups and game-winning moments, here are the biggest milestones, streaks and anniversaries to look for in the 2023-2024 NBA season.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<h2>Milestones</h2>\n<p><b>Points leaders</b></p>\n<p>James hit one of the biggest milestones in the NBA last season when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer. James has 38,652 points. This season he closes in on yet another record as he is 1,348 points away from scoring 40,000 points, which would stamp his name in the record books as the first player to hit the mark. This is a reasonable feat for the King to accomplish -- last season he scored 1,590 points -- and using James' career average in points per game (27.2), he could reach this milestone by his 49th game this season.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> is also looking to leap up the all-time scoring leaderboard as he needs 518 points to pass Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes and Moses Malone for the 10th-most points. Durant will look to settle into his second year with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a> as he spent a majority of last season dealing with injury and finishing with 208 points. If he can stay healthy, consistent and hit his career average in points per game (27.3), he will hit this mark by his 18th game of the season.</p>\n<p>If Durant wants to break into the top 10, he will need 1,705 points to pass Shaquille O'Neal and Carmelo Anthony for eighth on the all-time scoring list. He could reasonably hit this mark by his 62nd game. However, Durant hasn't played more than 55 games in a season since 2018-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Streaks in jeopardy?</strong></p>\n<p>Two of the biggest names in the league will look to maintain their respective scoring streaks.</p>\n<p>James is entering his 21st season and has scored 10-plus points in 1,151 consecutive regular-season games. He will look to expand the longest streak in NBA history in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>' season opener on Oct. 24 against the defending champion <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a> -- who holds the record for 3-pointers (3,390) after surpassing Ray Allen in 2021 -- will also look to increase his beyond-the-arc scoring streak. Curry has made at least one 3-pointer in 245 straight regular-season games, making it the longest 3-point streak in NBA history. In addition, he holds the record for multiple made 3-pointers, doing so in 56 consecutive regular-season contests. Curry and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> open the season at home against the Suns on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The importance of triple-doubles</strong></p>\n<p>Westbrook holds the record for the most career triple-doubles with 198. The All-Star point guard, entering his 17th season and first full one with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a>, is two triple-doubles shy of becoming the first player with 200.</p>\n<p>The closest active player to Westbrook's record is James, who has 107 triple-doubles and is only one shy of passing Jason Kidd for fourth place. However, 2023 Finals MVP <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic\">Nikola Jokic</a> is not far behind with 105.</p>\n<p>Harden could also potentially move up the leaderboard; he is five triple-doubles away from passing Wilt Chamberlain for seventh on the list.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.espn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n\n\n<h2>Anniversaries</h2>\n<p>From record-breaking wins to the most memorable game-winning shots, here are some historic moments being celebrated this season.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><strong>Five-year anniversary of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich becoming the winningest coach in NBA history:</strong> On April 13, 2019, Popovich earned his 1,413th win, passing Lenny Wilkens, to become the NBA's winningest coach.

  "<p>LOS ANGELES -- Bronny James, the 18-year-old son of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> superstar <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a>, is doing well and attending classes after the highly regarded freshman guard went into cardiac arrest during a workout last month, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans\">USC</a> basketball coach Andy Enfield said Monday.</p>\n<p>\"The good thing is he's doing extremely well and he's in class right now. And we all love him,\" Enfield said. \"I think everybody is hopeful that Bronny will return to the court. We just have to be patient and take it step by step.\"</p>\n<p>The James family released a statement Friday saying a congenital heart defect was the probable cause of James' cardiac arrest. The statement said the heart defect can be treated and that the family is confident in James' ability to make a full recovery and return to the court in the near future.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>James was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released three days after being stricken on July 24.</p>\n<p>\"Our goal is to support Bronny in any way we can academically, athletically, and be patient with how things develop in his return,\" Enfield said.</p>\n<p>James, a 6-foot-3 guard, committed to USC in May and bolstered what was already one of the nation's top recruiting classes.

We all think there is a big upside in his game and he can help our team win,\" Enfield said. \"It was a little later in the recruiting cycle and also was different because he comes from a pretty good basketball family. But it really didn't change our recruiting pitch because we're very honest with people and showed him an opportunity that we thought he could have here at USC.

  "<p>LOS ANGELES -- In a nod to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics\">Boston Celtics</a> legend <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4152/bill-russell\">Bill Russell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> will change his uniform number from 6 back to 23 for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> this coming season, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group told ESPN on Saturday.</p>\n<p>\"It's LeBron's decision,\" said Paul, James' longtime friend and agent. \"He chose to out of respect for Bill Russell.\"</p>\n<p>Last summer, after Russell died at the age of 88, the NBA retired No. 6 across the league -- the first time a player was honored in such a fashion. Current players wearing No. 6 at the time were grandfathered in and could keep the number should they so choose.</p>\n<p>The timing of the league's announcement made it a logistical impossibility to stock enough replica James jerseys to meet fan demand before the 2022-23 season started. James' No. 6 Lakers uniform led all player jersey sales on NBAStore.com for the second half of 2022-23, according to a league announcement.</p>\n<p><alsosee> </p>\n<p>\"For us to lose such an icon, it was heartbreaking for all of us,\" James told ESPN at the start of training camp in September. \"I mean, no matter if you play the game, watch the game or a part of the game. We all know what Bill Russell meant to the NBA, obviously to the Celtics off the floor as well, as far as his heroism ... and what he meant to Black people, being able to speak about issues that are not comfortable.</p>\n<p>\"For me to be able to wear No. 6 this season -- I'm not sure if I'll continue to do it, but right now I'm going to wear it in honor of him. It means a lot to me.\"</p>\n<p>Russell was an 11-time champion with the Celtics, a five-time MVP and a 12-time All-Star, and he became the first Black head coach in league history, winning his last two rings as a player-coach for Boston. Known as the sport's ultimate winner, Russell was honored in 2009 when the NBA Finals MVP trophy was named after him. </p>\n<p>James is a four-time recipient of the award, with Russell personally handing him the trophy after the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>' memorable Game 7 victory over the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> in 2016.</p>\n<p>James first wore No. 6 in international competition for Team USA and later wore it for the four seasons he played for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a>, as the organization had already retired No. 23 in honor of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/1035/michael-jordan\">Michael Jordan</a>. He went back to No. 23 from 2014 to 2021 -- the entirety of his second stint in Cleveland, plus his first three seasons in L.A. -- then wore No. 6 again his past two seasons for the Lakers.</p>\n<p>All told, James has worn No. 23 in 14 of his 20 NBA seasons, and that will become 15 out of 21 when he suits up for the Lakers in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While the Kansas City Royals can't exactly say the same, you can't rule out that the quarterback's winning ways might rub off on the franchise now that he is part of their ownership group.  If Mahomes' status as an icon in Kansas City was in question (it wasn't), this move surely cemented it. Becoming a baseball owner made sense on several levels for the Chiefs' QB1. Not only was Mahomes -- who played baseball in college -- a legitimate pro prospect, his father, Pat Mahomes, spent 11 seasons in Major League Baseball.

After a decade of underwhelming years, things look to be on the up for the now Hornets with Rookie of the Year <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432816/lamelo-ball\">LaMelo Ball</a> providing a long-awaited spark in the organization.

The deal has turned out to be pretty lucrative for James -- his original stake in the club, valued at about $6.5 million, had grown to about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23389022/liverpool-advancing-uefa-champions-league-final-financial-boon-lebron-james\">$32 million as of 2018.</a> In 2019, Liverpool won the Premier League for their first top-flight league title in thirty years.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr style=\"width:50%;\">\n\n\n<h3>James Harden -- Houston Dynamo, Houston Dash</h3>\n<p><photo13></p>\n<p>James Harden might not be in Houston anymore, but the former Rockets superstar's presence is still felt in the city. The Beard<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/major-league-soccer/story/3902104/nba-star-harden-buys-stake-in-mls-dynamo\"> purchased a 5% stake</a> in the group that controls MLS' Houston Dynamo and NWSL's Houston Dash in 2019. Boxer Oscar De La Hoya is also part of the group. The Dash won their first NWSL title last year, so he's probably feeling pretty good about that investment.</p>\n\n\n<hr style=\"width:50%;\">\n\n\n<h3>Russell Wilson and Ken Griffey Jr. -- Seattle Sounders</h3>\n<p><photo14></p>\n<p>What do Russell Wilson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Macklemore have in common?

Wilson, along with his wife, musician Ciara, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/seattle-sounders-fc/story/3919974/seahawks-qb-wilson-joins-sounders-ownership\">purchased a stake</a> in the team in 2019 -- just in time for them to win an MLS Cup title.

At the time, the price shattered the mark for a sports franchise. Magic kept it real at the time of purchase when explaining his role in recruiting free agents, saying that while he can't talk hitting or pitching with players, he \"can talk winning.\" If recent history is any indication (in case you blacked out all of 2020 -- the Dodgers won the World Series), it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

The day I can't give everything on the floor is the day I'll be done. Lucky for you guys, that day is not today.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>James was presented the award by his wife, Savannah, who was joined by their three children: 18-year-old Bronny, 16-year-old Bryce and 8-year-old Zhuri.</p>\n<p>\"Please welcome to the stage, the GOAT, respectfully, LeBron James,\" Savannah said.</p>\n<p>James, 38, used the occasion to reflect on how his children have fueled his continued passion for the game of basketball.</p>\n<p>Bronny will be a freshman on the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans\">USC</a> men's basketball team in the fall. Bryce transferred to Campbell Hall High School, where he will play his junior season. James recently coached Bryce's AAU team, Strive For Greatness, at the Peach Jam tournament in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>\"Tonight, I want to use this moment to just say something that I've said a million times and I will never get sick of talking about it: I love this game. I love the game of basketball,\" James said. \"There's a video going around right now on the internet of me coaching Bryce's team last weekend, and it's actually pretty funny. I saw a lot of posts with people talking about, 'LeBron brings the energy to a high school AAU game the same way he would do to a Finals game.' And to me, that's the ultimate compliment.</p>\n<p>\"In my 20 years playing this game and all the years before, I've never, ever cheated the game, and I will never take it for granted.\"</p>\n<p>With former teammates Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2581018/kentavious-caldwell-pope\">Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</a> in attendance Wednesday night, James detailed his dedication to the sport that has thrust him into the national spotlight for more than two decades.</p>\n<p>\"Every time I step foot on the floor, either coaching my boys or playing, I want to give it everything. I do it for myself,\" James said. \"I do it for some of my teammates that I've had before and now. And I do it for all the greats that came before me. And more importantly -- or most importantly -- I do it for the fans, the lovers of the game.</p>\n<p>\"Listen, you can love me -- and I know some of you hate me as well -- but the one thing you will always do is respect me and appreciate the way I approach the game and what I've given to this game.\"</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>James explained his mindset when, after scoring 40 points and playing all 48 minutes in the Lakers' Game 4 loss to the Nuggets, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37711722/lakers-lebron-james-says-consider-retirement-offseason\">he told ESPN</a> he had to think about \"if I want to continue to play.\"</p>\n<p>\"When the season ended, I said I wasn't sure if I was going to keep playing,\" James said. \"And I know a lot of experts told you guys what I said, but I'm here now speaking for myself. In that moment, I'm asking myself if I can still play without cheating the game -- can I give everything to the game still? The truth is, I've been asking myself this question at the end of the season for a couple years now. I just never openly talked about it.\"</p>\n<p>James also continued to distance himself from his prior wish to play on the same NBA team as one or both of his sons, saying, \"They're on their own basketball journey, and no matter how far they choose to go, they're not cheating the game. And that inspires me.\"</p>\n<p>In short, The King will return.</p>\n<p>\"You know what brings me back every year? It's watching and coaching my boys and their teammates,\" he said. \"I see those kids, and it brings me right back to why I play. Those kids get me back to where I need to be, just the pure love of his beautiful game.</p>\n<p>\"So, yeah, I still got something left. A lot left. I love you all, and thank you so much for watching this journey so far.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>The men's college basketball offseason offers an opportunity not only to reflect on the previous season, but to look back at nostalgic moments in the game's history.

The game has changed -- dramatically -- and that makes it difficult to have any fruitful conversations.</p>\n<p>Which is why we've decided to launch a series that focuses only on the past 25 years of men's college basketball. Any team, player, coach or moment that was part of the sport between the 1998-99 and 2022-23 seasons is eligible. The rest? That's someone else's problem.</p>\n<p>For this second installment of the series, we've compiled a list of the most significant \"What if?\" moments in college basketball over the past 25 years.</p>\n<p>For some schools, an injury changed a season or even the entire program. For others, it was a missed -- or a made -- shot or a decision made by a high-profile recruit.</p>\n<p>Either way, all fan bases know the pain of the \"What if?\" game. But we're not here to just bring up bad memories. We're here to help you heal. Here are the top moments that could have changed the sport for better, or worse, in the past 25 seasons.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What if...</h2>\n<h2>... <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> had gone to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/153/north-carolina-tar-heels\">North Carolina</a> or <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/150/duke-blue-devils\">Duke</a> over going pro</h2>\nSure, the NBA's all-time leading scorer had every reason to pick the pros over college in 2003, but last year he told Diana Taurasi and Sue Bird on \"The Bird & Taurasi Show\" that he would have picked North Carolina or Duke (if he couldn't pick his beloved <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes\">Ohio State</a>) had he decided not to turn pro. Could you imagine James during that 2003-04 season? He would have either played next to J.J. Redick, Duke's all-time leading scorer, or boosted the core of a Tar Heels squad that won a national title a year later. Whew.\n<p><inline1></p>\n<h2>... <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward\">Gordon Hayward</a> had hit the game winner against Duke in the 2010 national title game</h2>\nThere is possibly no greater \"What if?\" moment than the sight of the former <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2086/butler-bulldogs\">Butler</a> star nearly connecting on a half-court winner at the end of regulation in the 2010 national title game against Duke, only for it to clank off the front of the rim. If he'd made the go-ahead jump shot, Butler would have completed the game's first true David-over-Goliath victory in the national championship and changed the history of the sport.\n<h2>... Steph Curry had taken the last shot against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2305/kansas-jayhawks\">Kansas</a> in the 2008 Elite Eight</h2>\nWith seconds left to play in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2166/davidson-wildcats\">Davidson</a>'s 59-57 loss, Curry passed on a contested 3-pointer and instead dished to teammate Jason Richards, who missed the potential winning 3. If Curry had taken and made that shot (he was 4-for-16 from beyond the arc that night) against the eventual NCAA champion, he might have decided to turn pro that year, instead of the following year, and been drafted by a team not named the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a>.\n<h2>... Kenyon Martin had been healthy for the 2000 NCAA tournament</h2>\nMartin was averaging 18.9 PPG, 9.7 RPG and 3.5 BPG when he suffered a broken leg during the Conference USA tournament quarterfinals in 2000, an injury that cost <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2132/cincinnati-bearcats\">Cincinnati</a> a top seed in the tournament and a shot at the program's third national title. The Bearcats got outrebounded in a loss to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/202/tulsa-golden-hurricane\">Tulsa</a> in the second round, leaving their fans to wonder how a healthy Martin would have changed their fortunes that year.\n<h2>... Refs had properly called the foul, instead of a travel, against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3047/allan-ray\">Allan Ray</a> in the 2005 Sweet 16 against UNC</h2>\nAfter his team's miraculous comeback in the final minutes of the game, and down 66-63, the former <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/222/villanova-wildcats\">Villanova</a> star drove to the basket and scored, after it appeared he'd also been fouled. Instead of giving Ray the bucket and the free throw -- a chance to tie the score with 10 seconds to play -- officials called a traveling violation, clearing the way for the Tar Heels to eventually win it all. All video evidence, however, shows Ray taking just two steps.\n<p><inline2></p>\n<h2>... Kendall Marshall hadn't broken his wrist during the 2012 NCAA tournament</h2>\nEverything changed for North Carolina when its star point guard suffered a season-ending wrist injury during a double-digit win over <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/156/creighton-bluejays\">Creighton</a> in the second round. The Tar Heels lost to Kansas in the Elite Eight, never getting a chance at a rematch against eventual champ <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/96/kentucky-wildcats\">Kentucky</a> -- which beat UNC by a point earlier in the season.\n<h2>... <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/235/memphis-tigers\">Memphis</a> hadn't gone cold from the free throw line in the 2008 national title game</h2>\nBefore Mario Chalmers hit the magical trey that sent the Kansas-Memphis national title matchup to overtime in 2008, Memphis couldn't find a way to make a free throw. The Tigers missed four of five in the final 75 seconds of regulation before losing in overtime.\n<h2>... Brandon Ashley had been healthy in 2014</h2>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/12/arizona-wildcats\">Arizona</a> star was averaging 11.5 PPG and 5.8 RPG when he suffered a season-ending foot injury on Feb. 1, 2014, during an upset loss at <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/25/california-golden-bears\">Cal</a>. Would he have been a factor in helping Arizona -- also featuring future pros <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064290/aaron-gordon\">Aaron Gordon</a>, Nick Johnson, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2530530/tj-mcconnell\">T.J. McConnell</a> -- beat <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/275/wisconsin-badgers\">Wisconsin</a> in the Elite Eight, to reach the Final Four? We'll never know.\n<h2>... Roy Williams had stayed at Kansas</h2>\nAfter Kansas' 81-78 loss to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/183/syracuse-orange\">Syracuse</a> in the 2003 national title game, Williams said \"I could give a s--- about North Carolina right now\" when asked about the possibility of leaving the Jayhawks for the Tar Heels. Clearly conflicted about the opportunity to return to his alma mater, Williams ultimately chose UNC, and Kansas hired Bill Self -- two significant moves that have resulted in multiple national titles for both programs.\n<h2>... Officials had called a shot clock violation against Wisconsin in the 2015 Final Four</h2>\nWith 2:41 to play in Kentucky's 71-64 loss to Wisconsin, Badgers star Nigel Hayes scored on a putback that appeared to find the rim after the shot clock had hit zero. Although officiating had been criticized throughout the contest -- see: the no-call when <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136196/trey-lyles\">Trey Lyles</a> smacked Wisconsin's Josh Gasser earlier in the game -- Hayes' bucket tied the score at 60 and Kentucky never regained the lead.\n<p><inline3></p>\n<h2>... Robbie Hummel had been healthy for the 2010 postseason</h2>\nDuring the 2009-10 season, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2509/purdue-boilermakers\">Purdue</a> stars Robbie Hummel (15.7 PPG), E'Twaun Moore (16.4 PPG) and JaJuan Johnson (15.5 PPG) formed the strongest trio in the Big Ten and college basketball. That is until Hummel suffered a season-ending ACL tear a month before the NCAA tournament, which dashed Purdue's national title hopes and ended one of the most promising seasons in the school's men's basketball history.\n<h2>... Billy Donovan had taken the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a> job in 2007</h2>\nTwo months after he led <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/57/florida-gators\">Florida</a> to its second consecutive national championship, Donovan accepted the NBA job, before changing his mind a few days later and returning to Gainesville. Over the next eight seasons, Donovan would capture three SEC regular season titles, three SEC Coach of the Year honors, three more Elite Eight appearances and another trip to the Final Four in 2014 before he left for the NBA.\n<h2>... John Wall had picked North Carolina</h2>\nEarlier this year, the former NBA All-Star told the \"Run Your Race\" podcast that he considered signing with North Carolina over Kentucky for college until a negative encounter with Tar Heels legend <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3991/tyler-hansbrough\">Tyler Hansbrough</a> made him change his mind. Hansbrough refuted Wall's claims, but whatever the reason, John Calipari's trajectory at Kentucky would have been very different without Wall, who averaged 16.6 PPG during his single season in Lexington and helped the Wildcats reach the Elite Eight that year.\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<h2>... Fab Melo had been eligible for the 2012 NCAA tournament</h2>\nIn the 30 games that the late Fab Melo (7.8 PPG, 5.8 RPG, 2.9 BPG) played during the 2011-12 season, Syracuse was undefeated. The Orange's three losses that season -- including a loss to Ohio State in the Elite Eight -- were without Melo, who had been suspended due to academic issues. Syracuse fans will never know how far their team might have gone that year if Melo had been available (that season's wins were also later vacated by the NCAA due to an academic investigation).\n<h2>... Jodie Meeks had stayed and played for John Calipari's first Kentucky team</h2>\nMeeks turned pro after averaging 23.7 PPG for Kentucky in the 2008-09 season and secured second team All-American honors. Meeks made $30 million in the NBA, but a return to Kentucky for his senior season would have given Calipari's original Kentucky team the sharpshooter (Meeks made 41% of his 3-point attempts in the 2008-09 season) it desperately needed and a potential catalyst for a national championship run.\n<h2>... <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/41/uconn-huskies\">UConn</a> hadn't been a 9.5-point underdog against Duke in the 1999 national title game</h2>\n<p>The Blue Devils had won 32 consecutive games when they entered this national title matchup as nearly double-digit favorites to cut down the nets. The massive spread -- along with chatter Huskies players heard about local outlets selling national championship gear for Duke even before the game began -- served as motivation for a UConn team that pulled off one of the greatest upsets in college basketball history to capture the 1999 national title.</p>\n<p><inline4></p>\n<h2>... <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2724/wichita-state-shockers\">Wichita State</a> had been given a better draw in the 2014 NCAA tournament</h2>\nAn undefeated Wichita State team (34-0) was rewarded on Selection Sunday with a second-round matchup against a Kentucky team stacked with NBA talent. Shockers fans thought the committee's decision was punishment for its non-Power 5 schedule. After defeating WSU 78-76, Kentucky would reach the Final Four.\n<h2>... <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2250/gonzaga-bulldogs\">Gonzaga</a> hadn't blown a 17-point lead against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/26/ucla-bruins\">UCLA</a> in the 2006 Sweet 16</h2>\nGonzaga led by 17 late in the first half and by 14 midway through the second. But UCLA's comeback -- coined \"Heartbreak City\" -- robbed the Bulldogs of a trip to the Elite Eight that might have elevated Mark Few's profile and prompted him to consider other coaching opportunities earlier in his career.\n<h2>... Brandon Davies had been allowed to play in the 2011 NCAA tournament</h2>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/252/byu-cougars\">BYU</a> standout (11.1 PPG, 6.2 RPG in 2010-11) was ruled ineligible by the school for an \"honor code\" violation on the same day that the program was ranked No. 3 in The Associated Press poll, a few weeks before the tournament. Jimmer Fredette and Co. finished the rest of the season 5-3, a stretch that included an 83-74 overtime loss to Florida in the Sweet 16.\n<h2>... Samir Doughty hadn't been called for a foul against Kyle Guy in the 2019 Final Four</h2>\nAs <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers\">Auburn</a> led 62-60 with 0.6 seconds on the clock, Doughty put his hands up, stepped forward and made slight contact with Guy behind the line. Officials called a foul, the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/258/virginia-cavaliers\">Virginia</a> star hit all three free throws, and the Tigers lost their chance to play in the national title game, in one of the most controversial developments in NCAA tournament history.\n<p><inline5></p>\n<h2>... Bill Self had not missed the 2023 NCAA tournament</h2>\nThe longtime Kansas head coach had led his team to a 9-2 finish in its last 11 games of the regular season and a top-five finish in the AP poll. Kansas seemed positioned to vie for its second consecutive national championship until Self's health challenges sidelined him for both the Big 12 and the NCAA tournaments, where the Jayhawks lost to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/8/arkansas-razorbacks\">Arkansas</a> 72-71 in the second round.\n<h2>... The NCAA had held a 2020 NCAA tournament</h2>\nThe challenges around COVID-19 impacted multiple seasons in college basketball, but the elimination of the 2020 NCAA tournament created an unprecedented moment in college basketball history. Teams such as Kansas, Gonzaga, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/239/baylor-bears\">Baylor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2168/dayton-flyers\">Dayton</a> (which ended its season on a 20-game winning streak) and other contenders that year have all been left to wonder what would have happened if COVID hadn't cost the sport its postseason tournament.\n<h2>... Jon Scheyer had gone to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/356/illinois-fighting-illini\">Illinois</a></h2>\nLong before he was a second-team All-American who led the Blue Devils to the 2010 national championship and then their head coach, Scheyer was a five-star prospect from Illinois who considered staying home. Although then-Illinois head coach Bruce Weber's brother was Scheyer's head coach in high school, the talented guard chose to play for Coach K, a decision that might have helped Illinois avoid a lukewarm chapter after its 2005 national title game appearance.\n<h2>... The NBA's age limit hadn't compelled players to go to college</h2>\nIn 2005, the league announced it would require all draftees to be 19 years old and one year removed from high school -- a change that helped create the one-and-done era that exists. Without the rule, players like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3456/derrick-rose\">Derrick Rose</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson\">Zion Williamson</a> might have never played college basketball.\n<h2>... Aubrey Dawkins' putback had gone in versus Duke in the 2019 NCAA tournament</h2>\nZion Williamson and the 2018-19 Duke team nearly missed the NCAA tournament's second weekend when the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2116/ucf-knights\">UCF</a> star who finished with 32 points, nearly scored on a winning putback with 2.1 seconds left, allowing Duke to record a 77-76 victory. Had Dawkins completed the game-winner and led his father's current team to a win over his alma mater -- Johnny Dawkins was a star at Duke in the 1980s -- it would have been one of the most magical moments in NCAA tournament history.\n\n\n\n\n",
  "<p>LAS VEGAS -- As impactful as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> hope their new free agent signings will be next season, the most consequential development so far this offseason just might be the health of their two returning stars in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>.</p>\n<p>Both have recovered from the respective foot ailments they suffered and played through last season, according to Rob Pelinka, Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager.</p>\n<p>\"We feel good about the offseason and the treatment that AD and LeBron are getting,\" Pelinka said at halftime of the Lakers' summer league game against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte Hornets</a> on Sunday. \"All the reports have been good around both those injuries, in terms of the guys being able to move past them.\"</p>\n<p>James missed 13 straight games from late February until late March because of a torn tendon in his right foot. Though he was able to close out the regular season and helped lead L.A. to the Western Conference finals, his lift and burst were limited in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>The four-time MVP is entering his 21st season and will turn 39 in December.</p>\n<p>He told ESPN following L.A.'s Game 4 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> that he planned to get an MRI on his foot and could undergo surgery in the summer to correct the injury.</p>\n<p>Davis, meanwhile, missed 20 straight games from mid-December until late January with a bone spur and stress reaction in his right foot. Like James, he played every game in L.A.'s postseason run.</p>\n<p>The 11-year veteran will be eligible to sign a three-year, $167 million contract extension starting Aug. 4. Davis and James have two years remaining on their deals with the Lakers and both have a player option for 2024-25.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Pelinka, citing the collective bargaining agreement, declined to discuss the Lakers' extension plans for Davis next month.</p>\n<p>\"I wish the CBA allowed us to talk about negotiations ... but there's pretty strict rules around that,\" Pelinka said. \"So can't really talk about contracts and negotiations, but couldn't think more highly of Anthony Davis as a Laker and as a player. He's helped deliver a championship to our franchise.</p>\n<p>\"He's been an incredible captain and leader. We saw last year, willing to play through a hard foot injury to get our team to the Western Conference finals. So, just love having him as a part of our team.\"</p>\n<p>Pelinka did say he has been in contact with Davis about the Lakers' roster construction, however.</p>\n<p>L.A. signed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397077/jaxson-hayes\">Jaxson Hayes</a> to a one-year minimum contract with the hope to play the 7-foot, 220-pound center in the lineup alongside Davis at the 4 -- similar to the way Davis played with Dwight Howard and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3452/javale-mcgee\">JaVale McGee</a> at center en route to the title in 2020.</p>\n<p>\"I think [of] Jaxson much like Dwight Howard in that stretch for us: big body, rim protector, active roller,\" Pelinka said.</p>\n<p>Pelinka also addressed Hayes' 2021 arrest when police responded to a domestic disturbance call. Hayes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34093586/new-orleans-pelicans-jaxson-hayes-sentenced-probation-community-service-following-july-2021-arrest-los-angeles\">was sentenced in June 2022 to three years of probation, 450 hours of community service and a year of weekly domestic violence classes</a> after getting into a confrontation with officers and pleading no contest to misdemeanor counts of false imprisonment and resisting an officer.</p>\n<p>\"I think the most important thing is we take those things very seriously and do a full vetting process,\" Pelinka said. \"Jaxson has been very sincere [with] his apologies around handling that and has moved beyond it to where he's had a year or two in the NBA playing after it. It was something that we felt like he owned, took responsibility for it, and is going to be a better person on the other side of it.\"</p>\n<p>Beyond Hayes, Pelinka said L.A. is \"actively in the market to add another big,\" and hinted that the Lakers would pursue a player with stretch 5 capabilities.</p>\n<p>\"I think dimensional-izing the skills at that position would be important,\" Pelinka said. \"So we don't want to sign someone who replicates the skills that Jaxson Hayes has. So, if we can diversify the big position and have different looks, that would be good.\"</p>\n<p>One big who is still unsigned and can stretch the floor is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3058254/christian-wood\">Christian Wood</a>, who played for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a> in Davis' last year with the franchise, 2018-19.</p>\n<p>Wood, 6-10, averaged 16.6 points and 7.3 rebounds for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a> last season, shooting 51.5% from the floor and 37.6% from 3.</p>\n<p>L.A. has two remaining roster spots open and plans to keep one vacant position for the start of training camp.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Predictably, the result was arguably the greatest team in league history and more clearly the best of the past quarter century.</p>\n<p>Despite integrating Durant and then losing him to an MCL sprain for all of March, Golden State still won 67 games, tied for the seventh-best winning percentage in NBA history. The Warriors then swept their way through the Western Conference playoffs, aided by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a>'s ankle sprain in Game 1 of the conference finals, and took the first three games of the NBA Finals before suffering their only playoff defeat in Game 4 at Cleveland.</p>\n<p>Golden State's 16-1 playoff record is the best of all time.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. 2000-01 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> (+10.8)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +3.4 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +18.3</p>\n<p>Since the NBA playoffs expanded to 16 teams in 1984, no team has improved more from the regular season to the playoffs than the 2000-01 \"light switch\" Lakers.

Come playoff time, they turned it up, sweeping the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks</a> in the second round. Then, after famously falling behind 3-1, Cleveland unleashed an incredible three-game win streak to defeat the 73-win Warriors in Game 7 on the road.</p>\n<p>Cleveland's adjusted playoff rating is third-best in the past quarter century, trailing only the 2001 Lakers and 2017 Warriors.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. 2017-18 Golden State Warriors (+10.0)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +6.0 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +14.0</p>\n<p>By Durant's second year with the team, the regular season had become a slog for the Warriors, who won nine fewer games than in any of their previous three Finals runs. Golden State was then pushed to the brink by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a> in the conference finals, needing to win the last two games (including Game 7 in Houston) to get back to the Finals.

The playoffs were shakier; Boston needed seven games in each of the first two rounds before dispatching a Lakers team similar to the one higher on this list in the Finals.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. 1998-99 San Antonio Spurs (+8.9)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +8.1 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +9.8</p>\n<p>No asterisk necessary. Playing a shortened, 50-game schedule after the lockout pushed the start of play into 1999. The Spurs were both the NBA's best team during the regular season (winning at a 61-win clip over a full 82 games) and in the playoffs. They swept the Lakers and the Blazers in the West playoffs and needed just five games in the Finals to defeat the eighth-seeded <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a>.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. 2012-13 Miami Heat (+8.6)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +7.9 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +9.4</p>\n<p>No champion in NBA history came closer to losing than the 2012-13 Heat, who needed Allen's memorable 3-pointer to force overtime in Game 6 of the Finals against San Antonio and avoid elimination. With that lifeline, Miami won the series and a second straight championship -- this time with a much more impressive regular season. The Heat won 27 games in a row in February and March -- the longest streak in a single season in the past five decades.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>11. 2011-12 Miami Heat (+8.4)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +6.0 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +10.7</p>\n\n\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n<p>After falling short in the 2011 Finals, Miami adjusted by adding shooting and playing faster in the second season of the Heatles. But it wasn't until Chris Bosh was sidelined midway through the second round that Erik Spoelstra fully embraced small ball, bringing Bosh back as a center while Miami came back from a 3-2 deficit to beat the Celtics in the conference finals. After dropping Game 1 of the Finals in Oklahoma City, the Heat won four straight for James' first title.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>12. 2001-02 Los Angeles Lakers (+8.3)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +7.1 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +9.6</p>\n<p>As one of three teams in the West to win at least 58 games, the last of the three Lakers' title teams had to go through both of the others to get back to the Finals. Everyone remembers the Lakers' Game 7 win in Sacramento in a series marred by controversial refereeing. Forgotten is the Lakers blowing past a 58-win Spurs team in five hard-fought games.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>13. 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs (+8.2)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +8.4 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +8.0</p>\n<p>Benefiting from upsets elsewhere, the Spurs faced a 51-win Utah team in the conference finals and a 50-win Cleveland team in James' first Finals appearance, dispatching of both with ease. To get there, San Antonio had to beat a 61-win <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a> team in the conference semifinals, a matchup remembered for the suspensions of Boris Diaw and Amar'e Stoudemire during Game 5 in Phoenix after the Suns had tied the series 2-2.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>14. 2018-19 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/tor/toronto-raptors\">Toronto Raptors</a> (+8.2)</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +6.1 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +10.2</p>\n<p>As they integrated Leonard and dealt with his load management after an offseason trade with San Antonio, the Raptors played their best basketball in the playoffs. Leonard's heroic series helped them outlast the 76ers in seven games in the conference semifinals. Toronto then won four consecutive games against the 60-win Bucks after falling to an 0-2 deficit and took down a short-handed but more experienced Warriors team. Adjusted for opposition, it rates as the 10th-best playoff run on this list.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>15. 2004-05 San Antonio Spurs (+8.0)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +7.8 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +8.1</p>\n<p>The Spurs' third title team had a slightly different balance with the development of young guards Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker as perimeter counterweights to Duncan. San Antonio outplayed the 62-win Suns in the conference finals, spoiling Steve Nash's first year in Phoenix. But the Spurs then went the full seven games in the Finals against the defending champion Pistons.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>16. 1999-2000 Los Angeles Lakers (+7.9)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +8.5 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +7.3</p>\n<p>Jackson's first Lakers squad boasts the fourth-best regular-season differential among champions since his Bulls' teams. The playoffs were a different story for the Lakers, who went the distance in the first round and needed a fourth-quarter comeback in Game 7 of the conference finals against Portland. Their plus-2.3 margin of victory in the playoffs is the lowest for any champion in the 16-team playoff era, albeit against a difficult slate of opponents.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>17. 2003-04 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons\">Detroit Pistons</a> (+7.8)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +5.8 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +9.7</p>\n<p>By virtue of the biggest midseason trade for a champion in this span, bringing Rasheed Wallace to complete their starting five, the Pistons were legitimately a different team in the playoffs. After Detroit won just 54 games in the regular season, its defense cramped opponents as the Pistons took down a 61-win Indiana team in the conference finals and then upset the Lakers 4-1 in the Finals.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>18. 2021-22 Golden State Warriors (+7.7)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +5.5 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +9.9</p>\n<p>Injuries to Curry and Green were big factors in the Warriors winning just 53 games that regular season -- easily the fewest among their Finals appearances. Largely healthy in the playoffs, Golden State never went the distance in any series, and only a series of losses in potential closeout games (including by 39 points in Game 5 at Memphis) prevented the Warriors' adjusted playoff rating from reaching double digits.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>19. 2002-03 San Antonio Spurs (+7.5)</h2>\n<p><inline3></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +5.4 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +9.6</p>\n<p>Despite winning a league-high 60 games, the 2002-03 Spurs had far and away the worst regular-season differential of their five championship teams. In the playoffs, San Antonio managed to win all four series in precisely six games, including a conference finals showdown with the Dallas team that boasted the league's best differential.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>20. 2010-11 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a> (+7.3)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +4.2 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +10.4</p>\n<p>Dallas' point differential in the regular season was third-lowest among champions since 1998.

Milwaukee's most impressive stretch was winning the final four games of the Finals against Phoenix after going down 2-0.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>22. 2019-20 Los Angeles Lakers (+7.2)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +5.8 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +8.6</p>\n<p>Again, no, there are no asterisks here, but the Lakers' bubble run featured the weakest competition in terms of regular-season point differential since 1998. There's a case to be made that the Heat team the Lakers faced in the Finals was far stronger than that indicates, however, and the Lakers did go an impressive 16-5 en route to the title.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>23. 2009-10 Los Angeles Lakers (+6.4)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential: </strong>+4.7 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential: </strong>+8.1</p>\n<p>Coming off the 2009 championship, the Lakers won eight fewer games in the regular season and needed to go the full seven games to beat Boston in the Finals. While that Celtics team had knocked off two East powers (Cleveland and Orlando) along the way, Boston's middling regular season hurts the Lakers' rating.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>24. 2005-06 Miami Heat (+5.7)</h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>RS point differential</strong>: +3.9 <br>\n<strong>Adjusted PO differential</strong>: +7.6</p>\n<p>Look, somebody has to come in last of these rankings of the best of the best NBA teams over the past quarter century. After winning 59 games in Shaquille O'Neal's first year in Miami before losing in the conference finals to Detroit, the 52-win Heat turned the tables on a Pistons team that won 64 games and knocked off the 60-win Mavericks in a Finals upset. Still, Miami's plus-3.8 playoff point differential was second-worst among champions since 1998.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where might this year's champion rank?</h2>\n\n\n<p>As success in the regular season and playoffs increasingly diverges, my method might have a more difficult time rating contemporary champions. The Nuggets are a good example. By virtue of facing the seventh-seeded Lakers in the conference finals and eighth-seeded Heat in the Finals, Denver's strength of schedule would rank as the worst in modern history despite the upsets those teams previously pulled off.</p>\n<p>Add in the Nuggets' own middling regular-season point differential (plus-3.3) and they entered the Finals with a plus-6.3 rating that would put them 24th on this list, ahead of only 2005-06 Miami. That's despite Denver outscoring opponents by 9.3 PPG in the West playoffs, a top-five mark in this span if it holds.</p>\n<p>Still, that's better than the Heat. By virtue of getting outscored by 0.3 PPG in the regular season, Miami would inevitably displace its 2006 predecessors as the lowest-ranked champion since 1998 by coming back to beat the Nuggets. The Heat's playoff rating through the conference finals, though stronger, would still rank just 17th among the group.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

Cleveland jumped out to a 31-11 lead after the first quarter and won by 15 points to set up a Game 7 for the ages.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- Dave McMenamin</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>2.

But for him to also go 17-for-19 from the free throw line, after all of the chatter about his foul shooting during the postseason, was the definition of rising to meet the moment.</p>\n<p>And, as a result, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks were able to celebrate a championship on their home floor in Milwaukee.</p>\n<p><i>-- Tim Bontemps</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>3.

Butler scored 40 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds in a win that not only kept the Heat in the series, but further cemented his status as one of the game's premiere playoff players.

Butler knew he had to set a tone for the rest of his teammates and that's exactly what he did, following up his Game 3 showcase with another game that will be remembered within the Heat organization for years. Aside from Butler's ability to make big plays all over the floor, the picture of an exhausted Butler from this game remains one of the most memed in history.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- Friedell</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>5.

He also had 8 rebounds and 8 assists, all against one of the greatest teams ever assembled. The masterful performance still wasn't enough to get a win, as the Warriors prevailed in overtime with two crucial sequences going against the Cavs. First, James was called for a blocking foul on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> with 36 seconds left and Cleveland up two. Had it been a charge, maybe things would have been different. And second, in one of the most memed moments of James' career, JR Smith dribbled out the clock when <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3438/george-hill\">George Hill</a> missed a free throw with four seconds left with the score tied, rather than go for the go-ahead bucket near the hoop, causing James to splay his arms toward his teammate in exasperation.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- McMenamin</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>6.

It was the most blocks and steals ever recorded in a 30-20 Finals outing and the third-most assists. Duncan was almost as dominant in the closeout Game 6, putting up a 21-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist, 8-block line to clinch his second Finals MVP.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- Tim MacMahon</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>7.

He had 43 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists, but it was a clutch 3-pointer over two Cavs defenders with 52 seconds left that sealed both the game and his place in Finals history. An all-time dagger from an all-time player. Durant would go on to win his second straight Finals MVP and lead the Warriors to their second consecutive title.</p>\n<p><i>-- Friedell</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>8.

Then James burst out an indulgent chuckle. It was the start of the most significant postseason stretch of his career, winning Games 5 through 7 to help the Cavaliers become the first team in Finals history to climb out of a 3-1 deficit and win. James was brilliant in Game 5, putting up 41 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks as he and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving\">Kyrie Irving</a> became the first pair of teammates to ever drop 40-plus in the same Finals game.

But the fact that James nearly closed out the bubble by making 15 out of 21 shots -- including 6-of-9 3s -- to score 40 points with 13 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals while wearing the \"Black Mamba\" uniform that held so much significance to the Lakers' franchise that season in remembering Kobe Bryant makes it one of the finest playoff games of James' or any other player's career.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- McMenamin</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>11.

It was one of the highest scoring performances in Finals history and put the Bulls on the verge of their first three-peat.</p>\n<p>Chicago won the first two games of the series on the road before dropping Game 3 after returning home, but Jordan would not allow the Suns back into the series. Phoenix had no answer in stopping him from getting to the rim and Jordan shot 56.8% from the field with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. Jordan's 55 points are tied for the second-most in Finals history, trailing only a 61-point game by Baylor in 1962.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- Jamal Collier</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>12.

Fresh off a Game 7 comeback to beat the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, O'Neal served the Pacers notice in the series opener at the then-Staples Center, putting up 41 points on 21-of-31 shooting and 19 rebounds as the Lakers pulled away late. The 21 field goals were one shy of Baylor's 1962 Finals record, which came on 15 more shot attempts.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- Pelton</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>13.

With a loss all but certain to end Milwaukee's season, Antetokounmpo made sure that would not happen, going for 41 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists in just under 38 minutes, while also going -- in a precursor to his truly legendary performance in Game 6 -- 13-for-17 from the foul line. It wound up being the first of four straight wins for the Bucks in the series, as Milwaukee would go on to win its first title since 1971.</p>\n<p><i>-- Bontemps</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>14. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a>, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 37.2</h2>\n<p><photo4></p>\n<p><b>2019 Finals:</b> Game 3 vs. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/tor/toronto-raptors\">Toronto Raptors</a></p>\n\n\n<p>The barrage of shots from all over the floor started early in a Game 3 loss to the Raptors as Curry carried an offense playing without star forward Durant, who was out because of an Achilles injury. While he couldn't carry the Warriors to a victory, Curry hit six 3-pointers and scored 47 points, giving Warriors fans one last show in Oracle Arena before the team moved to Chase Center after the season. While Curry's performance was a highlight for the Warriors, this series will always be remembered by Durant's Achilles tear in Game 5 and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6475/klay-thompson\">Klay Thompson</a>'s ACL tear in Game 6.</p>\n\n\n<p><i>-- Friedell</i></p>\n\n\n<h2>15.

Only one problem: Jordan also scored 42 points, coming within an assist of a triple-double.

  "<p><video1></video1></p>\n<p>Back in February, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/d'angelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a> spoke to reporters about a fresh start on the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, nearly six years after last suiting up for the purple and gold. He exuded confidence about the player he had become since starting with the Lakers after being selected as the No. 2 pick in the 2015 NBA draft as a teenager.</p>\n<p>As he reflected on his memories of teaming up with Kobe Bryant, pivoted from his experience with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> and looked ahead to playing alongside <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a>, Russell said something meant to be boastful that can be interpreted much differently now that the Lakers season is over.</p>\n<alsosee>\n<p>\"I know I'm dangerous on the floor,\" Russell said Feb. 10 at the Lakers' practice facility.</p>\n<p>Three months later, Russell's production tanked when L.A. needed him most on the floor in the Western Conference finals.</p>\n<p>He averaged just 6.3 points on 32% from the field (13.3% from 3) and 3.5 assists in the four-game sweep to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter of Game 3, with the Lakers back home and facing an 0-2 deficit, he shot 0-for-4 with two turnovers -- one because of an off-target crosscourt pass he threw that was intercepted by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2581018/kentavious-caldwell-pope\">Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</a>. It ignited a fast break for Denver, prompting Lakers coach Darvin Ham to call timeout and sub Russell out.</p>\n<p>He lost his starting spot in Game 4 -- the only game he came off the bench in the 34 games (regular season, play-in and playoffs) he played for L.A. after the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35618590/lakers-finalizing-3-team-trade-dangelo-russell\">three-team trade to acquire him</a> -- and had his minutes cut to 15 in the loss.</p>\n<p>\"It was tough to agree with it, obviously,\" Russell said of the benching. \"But in the short period of time, [it was important] to not become a distraction to your teammates and to everybody else that's preparing just like you to get the one goal done, which is win. I knew that was where you have to be professional.\"</p>\n<photo1>\n<p>To judge Russell's impact on the Lakers off those four games against the Nuggets would be shortsighted. The four games he had in Games 1 and 6 in both the Memphis and Golden State series -- 22 points on 51.5% shooting and 4.5 assists in four wins -- were major contributions in getting L.A. to the conference finals.</p>\n<p>Russell is eligible to sign a two-year, $67.5 million extension by June 30, which the Lakers will not pursue at the max number, sources familiar with the situation told ESPN.</p>\n<p>And the market could be flat for the 27-year-old Russell, as the teams with that type of cap space this summer -- Houston, San Antonio, Utah, Orlando, Oklahoma City, Detroit and Indiana -- are either still in rebuild mode or already filled at the position.</p>\n<p>Beyond James' retirement decision -- which could be a nonissue, with a source close to James telling ESPN on Thursday that he believes the Lakers star will indeed be back for season No. 21 and fulfill his contract -- the biggest question facing the Lakers this offseason is figuring out what to do at point guard.</p>\n<p>After L.A. spent 1½ seasons reeling from its 2021 trade to acquire <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook\">Russell Westbrook</a>, the need to get the position right should be fresh on the minds of the front office.</p>\n<p>Here are the three directions the Lakers can take this summer to address their point guard situation, while rounding out the roster to try to compete, once again, for a championship next season:</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>1. Run it back</h2>\n<p>\"I would say this resoundingly clear: Our intentions are to keep our core of young guys together,\" Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka said Tuesday before exit interviews.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>This would include making an extension offer to Russell -- perhaps in the $18 million to $23 million annual compensation range depending on the contract length -- picking up the team option on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278077/jarred-vanderbilt\">Jarred Vanderbilt</a> ($4.6 million) and re-signing restricted free agents <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066457/austin-reaves\">Austin Reaves</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066648/rui-hachimura\">Rui Hachimura</a> (for both, L.A. can match any outside offers that might come to retain them).</p>\n<p>The Lakers' 18-8 record in the regular season after the trade deadline would be an argument to stay the course and consider the Denver series -- against a team with far more continuity and familiarity from the last several years -- part of the growth process.</p>\n<p>\"I think that team, there's not really a lot of holes in their system,\" Russell said of the Nuggets. \"It also shows the league what a year of chemistry can do for an organization and for a team and coaching staff.\"</p>\n<p>This would also allow L.A. to see how the group looks to start next season and figure out if it recaptures the magic it had to finish out 2022-23, and then have a larger sample size to make decisions off of.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2. Shake it up</h2>\n<video2>\n<p>L.A. could decide to let Russell walk as a free agent and replace him via trade. The Lakers have an option on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907822/malik-beasley\">Malik Beasley</a> ($16.5 million), and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277919/mo-bamba\">Mo Bamba</a>'s $10.3 million for next season becomes guaranteed if the Lakers don't waive him by June 29. Their deals, combined with Vanderbilt's contract and some assortment of the Lakers' upcoming draft picks -- they have Nos. 17 and 47 this year, and either their 2029 or 2030 first-rounders should hold a lot of value for their post-LeBron era potential -- can make them players on the market.</p>\n<p>Could that be enough to have Dallas cut bait on the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving\">Kyrie Irving</a>-<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic\">Luka Doncic</a> experiment and try to restock some of the depth it gave up to acquire Irving in the first place? Would Toronto accommodate a sign-and-trade with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet\">Fred VanVleet</a> if he doesn't pick up his $22.8 million player option for next season rather than seeing him potentially leave for nothing as an unrestricted free agent? While not a prototypical point guard, could the Lakers target a trade for Atlanta's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907497/dejounte-murray\">Dejounte Murray</a> for his defensive prowess -- hoping his addition could get the team out in transition more often where a traditional point guard with half-court sets sensibilities is less needed?</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>3. Split the difference</h2>\n<p>There's also the option to still prioritize re-signing Reaves and Hachimura, pick up the other contract options on the table and free up the full non-taxpayer midlevel exception (worth $12.2 million) to try to keep <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032979/dennis-schroder\">Dennis Schroder</a> -- who outperformed his veteran minimum contract this past season.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Or perhaps they would even be able to give Schroder the bulk of the MLE and save some of it to give a role player such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278508/troy-brown-jr\">Troy Brown Jr</a>. or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066264/wenyen-gabriel\">Wenyen Gabriel</a> -- two reserves who kept L.A. moving in the right direction despite the team's rocky start -- a raise beyond another minimum deal.</p>\n<p>It's one giant puzzle the Lakers will try to figure out between now and the June 22 draft when teams look to make deals leading up to the start of free agency June 30.</p>\n<p>The franchise has momentum for the time being, but how it manages decisions over the next six weeks could very well determine if that momentum carries over into training camp in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n</video2>",
  "<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p>LOS ANGELES -- As Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny walked to their $30,000 seats at halftime, large bodyguards stayed close. Kardashian stopped to chat with Rich Paul, the mega-agent of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> and other NBA stars, while Jenner waved to friends as she passed. Bad Bunny, the Latin music superstar who set a Spotify record last year with 18.5 billion streams, trailed the two fashion icons.</p>\n<p>That night, Crypto.com Arena -- where the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> were hosting the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> in Game 6 of the NBA's Western Conference semifinals -- looked like a Hollywood party, full of large men with earpieces and shiny chains and rings worn by the VIPs who were there to watch James and his teammates eventually advance in the playoffs. Rappers Jack Harlow and Tyler, the Creator embraced one another. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/rpm/driver?seriesId=6&driverId=868\">Lewis Hamilton</a>, the Formula One star, stood and nodded to a screaming crowd when he was shown on the JumboTron. Blockbuster actors Michael B. Jordan and Leonardo DiCaprio cheered from the front row.</p>\n<p>Two miles away, Craig Kelley, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans\">USC</a>'s chief marketing officer and associate athletic director, wondered how his school will handle home games when Bronny James -- son of LeBron James, boasting more than 7 million Instagram followers and having recently committed to the Trojans -- arrives in the fall and some of the same celebrities decide to watch him, too.</p>\n<p>Next season, father and son will be separated by a 2-mile stretch along Figueroa Street between the Galen Center, home of the Trojans, and Crypto.com Arena.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>After the Lakers were swept by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> in the Western Conference finals Monday, however, LeBron James told ESPN's Dave McMenamin, \"I got to think about it,\" when he was asked to follow up on postgame comments that alluded to a potential retirement.</p>\n<p>LeBron also said he's still better than \"95 percent\" of the NBA, and sources told McMenamin this year's playoffs had been physically taxing on the 38-year-old, so perhaps his comments were more emotional than realistic.</p>\n<p>Whether LeBron pushes forward with his dream to one day play with Bronny or exits the game this offseason as one of the greatest to ever step onto a basketball court, the intrigue and anticipation around his son's collegiate career will persist.</p>\n<p>\"There is an added tier here, an added level, for sure, with the family ties Bronny comes with and the friends that not only he has but that his family has, and the following that could follow him and come to games on any given night,\" Kelley told ESPN. \"It's up to us to prepare.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>There are no comparisons to the spotlight that will illuminate every Bronny bucket, pass, shot, win, loss, rebound, foul, free throw, turnover, miss, triumph and challenge in 2023-24. He is not the first athlete with a large social media following to play college basketball. He's also not the first child of a high-profile athlete to play at this level. But Bronny James is a member of basketball's royal family, a projected lottery pick in the 2024 NBA draft (per ESPN) who comes with bodyguards and a legendary father -- who continues to compete at the highest levels of the NBA and has been open about his desire to extend his career a few more years just so he can play with his son when he presumably joins the league in 2024.</p>\n<p>With the attention, however, will come an intentional approach from school officials, local police and private security personnel to ensure that the 18-year-old is free -- and safe -- to enjoy his on-campus experience. At USC, Bronny will join a class that includes the children of dignitaries, actors and actresses, politicians and athletes. In college basketball, however, he will be a prince, drawing a crowd wherever he goes.</p>\n<p>\"Basketball-wise, you just need that big name to come there and bring that attention, and he's the perfect person for that,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a> star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3978/demar-derozan\">DeMar DeRozan</a>, a former USC standout, said recently on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george\">Paul George</a>'s \"Podcast P\" podcast. \"I think the way he comes in, the way he'll handle it and the attention he's going to bring, I think it's going to push USC to another level that we haven't seen.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><video1></p>\n<p><strong>IN 2019, BRONNY</strong> joined his Sierra Canyon teammates at an event called Hoopfest in Dallas. The first day took place at a local high school, before the demand to see Bronny, just a freshman who came off the bench at the time, grew. That prompted organizers to move Sierra Canyon's game the following day against local powerhouse Duncanville to American Airlines Center, where the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a> play. Scalpers showed up outside the arena, selling tickets to the high school game before tipoff.</p>\n<p>When a group of teenage girls tried to get a selfie with Bronny inside, a security team stepped in front of them and told them to move back. One of the girls seemed perplexed and another said, \"Oh?\" Surrounded by his traveling layer of protection, Bronny didn't seem to notice. He laughed with friends as it all unfolded behind him. Perhaps a familiar scene in Hollywood, college basketball is not known for hosting players with individual security details. But that's what Bronny will bring to USC.</p>\n<p>The school is already a football giant, starring quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams\">Caleb Williams</a>, who could become the second player in collegiate history to win the Heisman Trophy twice. Basketball is making waves, however, and not just because of Bronny. Juju Watkins, the No. 1 women's basketball recruit in the country, arrives this fall, joining a list of stellar women's players in school history, including Lisa Leslie and Cheryl Miller. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/242797/isaiah-collier\">Isaiah Collier</a>, the No. 1 recruit in men's basketball, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4432103/dj-rodman\">DJ Rodman</a>, who transferred from Washington State and is the son of Dennis Rodman, will play alongside Bronny next year, too.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Despite a run of five NCAA tournament appearances over the past eight seasons, including an Elite Eight run in 2021, men's basketball has rarely enjoyed sellout crowds. The program averaged just 3,860 spectators at the 10,258-seat Galen Center during the 2021-22 season, per the most recently available data from the NCAA.</p>\n<p>This year, to contend with the star power, the school could create a separate entrance for celebrities and other VIPs who want to watch Bronny and USC men's basketball. It also plans to adjust security measures for players as general attendance increases.</p>\n<p>Per Kelley, the ticket prices will rise, too. But a \"Bronny tax\" is not the plan. \"I know it's going to be hard to believe, but with or without Bronny, the prices were more than likely going to go up by a few percentage points just because that's just the nature of the business,\" Kelley said. \"Most teams are increasing their prices 2 percent to 3 percent annually. We've actually been flat for quite some time, and so we were going up in price just because the team has just gotten better. And you do add some notable name players.\"</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>This is not the first time the program has experienced a major shift in popularity. The team hadn't been to the NCAA tournament in four years when Harold Miner, nicknamed Baby Jordan because of his high-flying maneuvers, arrived in 1989.</p>\n<p>\"There were so few fans that the first few games of my freshman year, you could hear people talking in the stands during games,\" Miner, a 1992 consensus All-American who averaged 23.5 PPG in three years with the Trojans before the Miami Heat made him the 12th pick in the 1992 NBA draft, told ESPN. \"You could hear conversations going on in the stands.\"</p>\n<p>Miner, who is one of two USC men's basketball players over the past 40 years to have his number retired (DeRozan is the other), was a hometown hero who can relate to the frenzy Bronny will experience next season in a city full of celebrities, albeit without the TikTok and Twitter attention.</p>\n<p>He said he knew his reputation had changed when he walked around Los Angeles and people began to call his name or ask for autographs after he led the team to the NCAA tournament in the early 1990s. Considered one of the biggest stars in USC men's basketball history, Miner said he would advise Bronny to stay true to himself.</p>\n<p>\"All you can do is listen, go out, work hard every day and get better,\" Miner said. \"But for yourself, just try to be the best Bronny you can be for you and just try to see where you can take this.\"</p>\n<p>Police Chief Lauretta Hill, who leads USC's department of public safety, said her office is always concerned about the possibility that an athlete's popularity could impact their safety. But the school's experience with celebrities and others with high profiles means it will be prepared for his arrival, she said.</p>\n<p>Last week, Sasha Obama -- daughter of former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama -- graduated from the school. Her parents, and the Secret Service officers who accompany them everywhere, were in attendance. Princess Salma bint Abdullah, daughter of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan, graduated from USC last week, too. She comes from a royal family with a net worth of $750 million. Natalia Bryant, daughter of the late Kobe Bryant, currently studies at the school.</p>\n<p>Hill's department has a unit devoted to social media threats, and it also coordinates with the university's office of executive protection services, which handles personal security for high-profile students.</p>\n<p>To Hill, Bronny's place in college basketball might be unique, but his presence on a star-studded campus is not, and that's a good thing. At USC, Bronny will stand out but also fit right in.</p>\n<p>\"We do have security plans in place for major events,\" she said. \"We also have active threat management and assessment units. That threat unit is constantly monitoring social media for any types of threats or issues that may come up so we could change our posture if we needed to. We can scale up. We can scale down. We can address those issues or threats that may be out there.\"</p>\n<p>She added: \"We anticipate that we'll have a lot more attention to basketball because we also have the No. 1 female recruit coming and the No. 1 male recruit coming.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><video2></p>\n<p><strong>THE REACH OF</strong> LeBron James is clear to anyone who tries to tell a story about Bronny. Off the court, beyond his business deals and achievements, one of the NBA superstar's greatest feats is his ability to shield his son and allow him to mature and blossom without exposing him to more attention.</p>\n<p>Bronny has famously never granted an interview, outside a brief news conference at the McDonald's All American game in March. And if you call anyone attached to him, they'll likely decline to talk about him. A high school administrator agreed to a conversation about the future USC signee but then decided against it. An official at a school that played Sierra Canyon told ESPN that his school does not talk about opponents. There were coaches who didn't return texts, and others who demanded that everything they said be off the record. Even those who did talk for this story did so with caution.</p>\n<p>From outside the circle, it seems extreme. But for a family led by the greatest basketball player since Michael Jordan, who was a star long before the advent of social media, it all makes sense. As does selecting USC, a school that can offer Bronny the opportunity to grow as a player, the protection his profile will demand and enough famous classmates to make him seem somewhat normal. That's an experience he would not get at most places.</p>\n<p>\"If you go to Lexington, Kentucky, you're going to stand out,\" said Todd Boyd, author of \"Young, Black, Rich, and Famous: The Rise of the NBA, the Hip Hop Invasion, and the Transformation of American Culture\" and a professor at USC. \"It's not a place you associate with famous people. If you go to Durham, North Carolina, or Lawrence, Kansas, you're going to stand out. Eugene, Oregon? You're going to stand out, because these are not places we associate with celebrities and famous people.</p>\n<p>\"I mean, Bronny is going to get a lot of attention. People know him from social media. He will get attention when [LeBron James] comes and sits courtside to watch him play. That's going to get attention. All these things are going to get attention, but it's not new [in L.A.].\"</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>Cleveland High (Reseda, California) head coach Dagem Asfaw was an assistant with Strive for Greatness, Bronny's grassroots squad, at a tournament in Kentucky last summer when a young fan spotted Bronny and his team attempting to leave through a back door for safety precautions. Within minutes, 30 kids were trying to get to the staircase to see Bronny, before his security team handled the situation.</p>\n<p>Asfaw had to deal with the same logistical challenges when his school hosted Sierra Canyon in November. There were secret entrances and exits, and a special section the school created just for that evening.</p>\n<p>LeBron attended, although Bronny did not play in the lopsided win for Sierra Canyon. Still, the school sold 60 VIP seats for $100 apiece, seats occupied by notable folks, such as Big Boi from the rap group Outkast.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't really tell anybody [LeBron James] was going to come besides principals and administrators,\" Asfaw said. \"So it was packed. A lot of the people, a lot of the students ... they wanted to see Bronny play. But there was also this mystique in the air with people saying, 'Is LeBron going to show up?' And LeBron ended up showing up to the game, which was amazing.\"</p>\n<p>That's the same scenario USC hopes to accommodate in the fall. And there will be times next season when a Los Angeles basketball fan has a chance to catch both Bronny at a USC game and his father at a Lakers contest, not only on the same night, but on the same street.</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>The Lakers' 122-101 win over the Warriors in that Game 6 showcased a glimpse of what USC men's basketball might experience when the Galen Center becomes one of the sport's most popular venues.</p>\n<p>It all starts with LeBron James, who lingered by his locker after the game, his legs wrapped in ice. He mentioned to teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> that his younger son Bryce's AAU squad had faced tough competition in its most recent tournament. Then he stood up, turned to his locker and pressed play.</p>\n<p>The groovy bassline of soul singer Bobby Womack's \"Across 110th Street\" began to boom through a waterproof speaker, echoing above any conversation in the room. In that song, Womack sings, \"You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure.\"</p>\n<p>No college basketball player in America understands that line more than Bronny, who plays under a giant microscope that will continue to follow him everywhere he goes next season.</p>\n<p>\"We're at USC in Los Angeles and this is the biggest stage you get,\" USC coach Andy Enfield said. \"We've got the No. 1 basketball market in the country here. We've got the Lakers and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">Clippers</a> right down the street. We've got <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/26/ucla-bruins\">UCLA</a> across town and all the other great colleges and high schools, the AAU programs here. So it's a big, big basketball city.</p>\n<p>\"When we recruit players, we say, 'Hey, you're coming into the No. 1 basketball city in America and you're going to be in the spotlight.' And now with Bronny's situation, the spotlight probably intensifies. And so you embrace it, enjoy it and you go do something about it.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n"
